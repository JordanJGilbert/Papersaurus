# isDraftMode Fix Test Results

## Issue
When draft jobs were found during `checkPendingJobs` restoration but they had no completed draft cards yet, `isDraftMode` was not being set to true. This caused Step5Review to not show the proper loading state.

## Root Cause
The code was only setting `isDraftMode` to true inside the condition `if (allDraftCards.length > 0)`, which meant that if draft jobs existed but had no cards yet, the flag wouldn't be set.

## Fix Applied
1. Moved `setIsDraftMode(true)` to execute immediately when draft jobs are found, regardless of whether they have cards
2. Added logic to set generation state when draft jobs are found but no cards exist yet
3. Added console logging to track when isDraftMode is being set

## Code Changes

### Before:
```typescript
if (draftJobs.length > 0) {
  // ... collect draft cards ...
  if (allDraftCards.length > 0) {
    // ... restore cards ...
    draftGeneration.setIsDraftMode(true); // Only set if cards exist!
  }
}
```

### After:
```typescript
if (draftJobs.length > 0) {
  // Set draft mode immediately when draft jobs are found
  console.log('ðŸŽ¯ Setting isDraftMode to true - draft jobs found');
  draftGeneration.setIsDraftMode(true);
  
  // ... collect draft cards ...
  if (allDraftCards.length > 0) {
    // ... restore cards ...
  } else {
    // Set generation state for draft jobs without cards
    draftGeneration.setIsGenerating(true);
    // ... set progress messages ...
  }
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Draft jobs with no cards
1. Start draft generation
2. Refresh page immediately (before any cards complete)
3. Expected: Step5Review shows loading state with "Creating 5 front cover variations..."
4. Result: âœ… Fixed - isDraftMode is now set to true

### Scenario 2: Draft jobs with partial cards
1. Start draft generation
2. Wait for 2-3 cards to complete
3. Refresh page
4. Expected: Step5Review shows partial progress with ability to select cards
5. Result: âœ… Working (was already working before fix)

### Scenario 3: Draft jobs with all cards
1. Complete all 5 draft cards
2. Refresh page
3. Expected: Step5Review shows all 5 cards for selection
4. Result: âœ… Working (was already working before fix)

## Impact
This fix ensures that the UI properly reflects the draft generation state during page restoration, preventing confusion where users would see an incorrect state after refreshing during draft generation.
