Avoid generic or clich\u00e9 designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"create a graduation card for us\"\nStyle: \ud83e\udd16 AI Smart Style\nTone: \ud83d\ude04 Funny - humorous and lighthearted\n\n\nMessage: \"Congrats on graduating to another year older! You've officially earned a degree in being awesome, with a minor in not acting your age. So proud of you!\"\n\nReference: \"turn both of us into cartoons\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n- Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a modern, stylized gouache and ink illustration style that balances celebratory energy with sophisticated nostalgia. The artwork should feature a rich, jewel-toned color palette dominated by deep emerald green, sapphire blue, and a warm, antique gold, accented with pops of creamy white and a soft, dusty rose. The central figure, based on the reference photo, will be rendered with clean, confident ink lines for their silhouette and key features, but the clothing (graduation gown) and hair will be filled with flat, opaque layers of gouache, showcasing visible, yet subtle, brushstrokes to add texture and a handcrafted feel. The background will be a semi-abstract wash of the emerald and sapphire tones, bleeding softly into one another, perhaps with delicate, hand-drawn constellations or scattered geometric shapes (like triangles and arcs) subtly overlaid in thin gold ink, symbolizing future opportunities and aspirations. Key elements, like the graduation cap's tassel and any diploma shown, should be highlighted with shimmering metallic gold gouache, making them catch the light. The overall mood is one of quiet triumph and elegance\u2014less about a raucous party and more about the beautiful, poignant culmination of a significant chapter.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! The AI has complete creative freedom to design whatever it wants for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a birthday card with humorous and lighthearted tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description. Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before! Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone.

Right Interior (Story Climax): BE CREATIVE WITH MESSAGE DESIGN! Include message text: \"Congrats on graduating to another year older! You've officially earned a degree in being awesome, with a minor in not acting your age. So proud of you!\" positioned safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image) integrated into beautiful, innovative decorative artwork. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the message - NO PEOPLE or characters.

Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO TEXT and NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals.
