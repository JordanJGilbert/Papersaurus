Your presence in my life is a gift I cherish more than words can say. Wishing you a birthday that's as full of joy as you bring to mine.\nAll my love,\nJordan\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the sincere and emotional tone throughout all sections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a contemporary abstract expressionist style, characterized by a vibrant, joyful explosion of layered textures and dynamic movement. The background is a soft, warm wash of pale lemon yellow, applied with a visible, gentle watercolor bloom effect that fades at the edges. Over this, a bold, confident swash of cerulean blue acrylic paint is applied with a palette knife, creating thick, tactile impasto ridges that catch the light. Splatters and drips of fluorescent pink and brilliant orange ink are scattered across the composition, conveying spontaneous energy and celebration. Accents of gold leaf are carefully hand-applied in small, fragmented flakes, adding a touch of sophisticated shimmer and luxury. The overall composition is non-representational, focusing purely on the emotional interplay of color, texture, and gesture to evoke an overwhelming feeling of pure, unadulterated happiness.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! The AI has complete creative freedom to design whatever it wants for this left interior page!

Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before! Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone.
