Two stylized, ethereal figures, one glowing in warm golden hues and the other in cool blue tones, are reaching out to each other across a deep indigo night sky filled with a nebula of blues and purples, and scattered stars. A delicate, luminous constellation connects their outstretched hands, symbolizing their bond. The overall artistic style is soft, painterly, and dreamy, with visible brushstrokes and gentle color blending, reminiscent of traditional watercolor art. The text \\\"Thinking of you, Kyler\\\" is elegantly rendered in a flowing, sophisticated cursive font in a light, creamy color, positioned in the upper-middle section of the card, avoiding the top and bottom 10% edges. The mood is inspirational, intimate, and full of wonder. The composition is dynamic, with the figures and constellation creating a visual connection that draws the viewer's eye. Maintain a 9:16 aspect ratio.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card featuring a subtle continuation of the celestial theme. The background is a deep indigo night sky with scattered, soft-focus stars and a hint of a distant, gentle nebula in shades of blue and purple. The composition is minimalistic and serene, focusing on the vastness of space. In the bottom right corner, a small, 1-inch square area is left completely clear and undecorated.

The art style is consistent with the front cover, utilizing soft watercolor textures and gentle color blending. The mood is peaceful and contemplative, providing a gentle resolution to the card's visual story.

The central focus is a stylized spiral galaxy composed of two distinct arms. The larger arm is rendered in a warm, glowing golden yellow, transitioning to lighter yellow dots along its curve. The smaller, inner arm is depicted in a soft, luminous purple, also formed by small dots.

The right trail is a delicate, ethereal purple, also forming a gentle arc and emanating from a cluster of bright, shimmering star-like points. These two trails meet and curve together, subtly suggesting the shape of a heart, symbolizing connection and affection.
