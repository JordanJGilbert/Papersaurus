    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card for Jordan from John, flat 2D watercolor painting style. A humorous and lighthearted scene featuring cartoon illustrated versions of the two men from the reference photo. The man on the left (Jordan) is playfully trying to blow out a single, very stubborn, magically re-lighting candle on a tiny cupcake he's holding. He has an exaggerated puffed-out cheeks expression of exertion. The man on the right (John) is laughing heartily, pointing at the candle with a mischievous grin, as if he's the one causing the magic. Capture their specific features, hair, and clothing styles from the photo, adapted into a charming, illustrated cartoon look. The background is a soft, light-colored wash with artistic paint splatters and organic bleeds, suggesting a festive but simple setting. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday\". The overall artwork has a distinct watercolor feel with soft flowing colors, visible brush strokes, and a subtle paper texture.",
    "backCover": "Back of a greeting card. A very minimal and simple design in a flat 2D watercolor painting style. The background is a soft, light-colored wash with a subtle paper texture, matching the front cover's aesthetic. In the top-left corner, there is a small, single watercolor cupcake, rendered simply with a swirl of frosting and a single unlit candle. The cupcake is painted with the same soft, flowing colors as the front, but is very small and unobtrusive. The majority of the card is empty space, particularly the bottom-right corner, which is completely clear. The overall feel is clean, elegant, and cohesive with the front design.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior panel of a greeting card. A subtle, decorative background in a flat 2D watercolor painting style. The entire panel is covered in a soft, light-colored watercolor wash with a visible paper texture and artistic, organic paint bleeds at the edges. A festive pattern of small, simplified watercolor elements is scattered across the panel; these include tiny cupcakes, single candles, and festive confetti shapes. The elements are painted with soft, flowing colors, creating a gentle, celebratory atmosphere without being distracting. There is no text or central focal point. The design is purely decorative and complementary to the card's overall theme.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to feature a printed message. The background is a very faint, light-colored watercolor wash with a subtle paper texture, ensuring maximum legibility for the text. A minimal decorative element, a simple watercolor border of festive confetti and tiny star shapes, frames the very top and bottom edges of the panel. The colors are soft and muted, matching the card's overall palette. The central area of the panel is clear and bright, perfectly framing the printed message: 'Jordan,\\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but I decided against it... out of respect for my elders. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\\nBest,\\nJohn'. The overall design is clean and focuses on the message."
