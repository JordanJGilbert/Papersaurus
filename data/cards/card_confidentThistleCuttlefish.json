    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a sophisticated watercolor painting style. A charming, stylized giraffe wearing a striped party hat and a monocle is depicted seated, with its head tilted and looking slightly downward. The giraffe has a gentle, somewhat melancholic expression. To the left of the giraffe is a vintage grand piano with its lid open. The giraffe's front legs are posed as if playing the piano, with one hoof resting on the keys and the other extended towards the keyboard. The color palette consists of warm, muted earth tones, including soft browns, creams, and subtle hints of pink in the party hat. The background is a textured, off-white watercolor wash, creating an elegant and refined atmosphere. The text \\\"Happy Birthday\\\" is written in a flowing, calligraphic script in a dark brown color, positioned centrally to the left of the giraffe, with \\\"Happy\\\" above \\\"Birthday\\\". Ensure text is at least 10% away from top/bottom edges and 0.5\\\" from left/right edges.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a sophisticated watercolor painting style. A subtle and elegant decorative element evoking the theme of music and celebration. This could be a softly rendered abstract representation of musical notes or gentle watercolor washes in the same warm, muted earth tones as the front cover, with faint organic paint bleeds and paper texture. No text or people. The design should be serene and complementary to the front cover, providing a peaceful resolution to the visual story.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior page of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a sophisticated watercolor painting style. This page continues the visual narrative with creative freedom. Depict an elegant, whimsical scene that complements the front cover. Imagine a softly blurred background of muted cream and beige watercolor washes, with delicate, abstract musical notes or faint patterns inspired by piano keys rendered in soft browns and subtle gold. The focus is on refined artistry and atmosphere, maintaining the sophisticated and elegant tone. No people or characters. Ensure the artwork feels connected to the music theme subtly hinted at on the front. Maintain consistent watercolor techniques, brush strokes, and color palette.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior page of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a sophisticated watercolor painting style. This page features the birthday message integrated into elegant, innovative decorative artwork. The text \\\"Wishing you a day filled with the kind of joy and laughter this card hopes to inspire. May the year ahead be as wonderfully brilliant and amusing as you are. Happy Birthday!\\\" should be presented in a refined, legible script, possibly in a dark brown or muted gold, positioned centrally within the safe printing area (at least 10% from top/bottom, 0.5\\\" from sides). The surrounding artwork consists of delicate, flowing watercolor elements that complement the theme â€“ perhaps abstract musical staves that morph into elegant swirls or subtle textures reminiscent of piano felt, rendered in the established warm, muted color palette. The design should be unique and artistic, avoiding clichÃ©s while harmonizing with the left interior page and the overall sophisticated tone.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a funny birthday card with an elegant watercolor style. The background is a soft, muted cream with a subtle paper texture. In the lower right quadrant, a small stack of sheet music, rendered with delicate watercolor lines and subtle shading, is visible. Resting on top of the sheet music is a festive, pink and cream striped party hat, also in a charming watercolor style, with soft paint bleeds. To the right of the party hat, a vintage-style monocle with a thin, brown string is depicted, adding an unexpected touch of sophistication. The composition is minimalist and serene, focusing on these few whimsical elements to provide a subtle and artistic conclusion to the visual story, referencing the celebratory and elegant theme without any text or additional characters. No space is reserved for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a funny birthday greeting card with a sophisticated and refined tone, rendered in a watercolor painting style. The artwork features a vibrant, abstract explosion of musical notes and swirling filigree. A large, golden treble clef anchors the upper left of the composition, with several golden musical notes scattered across the page, appearing to float upwards and outwards. These musical elements are interwoven with flowing, expressive watercolor brushstrokes in soft coral, muted teal, and warm ochre. These painterly lines create a sense of dynamic movement and organic growth, resembling unfurling ribbons or gentle waves, with delicate paper texture and subtle, organic paint bleeds adding depth and character. The overall impression is elegant, lively, and celebratory, with a harmonious color palette and an artistic, unexpected composition that evokes joy and amusement. The background is a soft, creamy off-white, allowing the watercolor elements to stand out vibrantly.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with the text \"Wishing you a day filled with the kind of joy and laughter this card hopes to inspire. May the year ahead be as wonderfully brilliant and amusing as you are. Happy Birthday!\" centrally positioned. The artwork features abstract, flowing watercolor brushstrokes in soft shades of blush pink, rose gold, and creamy beige, creating a gentle, undulating wave pattern that extends from the top edge and subtly wraps around the bottom. The background is a textured, off-white paper that allows the watercolor to blend organically. The typography for the message is in a classic, elegant serif font, dark grey in color, with generous line spacing for readability and to accommodate handwritten notes. The overall composition is refined and sophisticated, with the artwork acting as a subtle, decorative frame that doesn't overpower the central message area. The style is watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds."
