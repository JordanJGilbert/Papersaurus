Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"thank-you\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a **soft, luminous watercolor and ink illustration style, reminiscent of a cherished storybook**. The scene is bathed in the warm, gentle light of a California morning, with a palette of soft pastel greens, creamy sandstone, terracotta, and a sky of pale cerulean blue. The watercolor is applied with a wet-on-wet technique to create dreamy, blended backgrounds for the sky and foliage, while the architectural details of the Stanford campus are rendered with delicate, fine-tipped ink lines that have a slightly organic, hand-drawn feel. The overall effect is charming and painterly, focusing on the beauty of the natural campus environment. The cute, friendly green dinosaur is drawn with simple, rounded shapes and a whimsical smile, holding a small card that adds a touch of heartfelt playfulness, making the professional setting feel personal and warm. This style feels both beautiful and handcrafted, evoking a sense of genuine appreciation and happy memories.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY!

HANDWRITING STYLE: Write the message in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. The handwriting should be legible, flowing, and have natural character - not overly perfect but graceful and warm. Use a nice pen-style appearance with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight. Think of sophisticated calligraphy that's still approachable and easy to read.

Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters.

Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.
