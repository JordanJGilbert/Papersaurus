  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing birthday greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clich\u00e9 designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"Have learned so much from you and feel really grateful to have you as a friend in life!!\"\nStyle: \u2728 Smart Style\nTone: \ud83d\ude04 Funny - humorous and lighthearted\nTo: \u6ed1\u9e21\ud83d\udc14\nFrom: Nicole\nMessage: \"[Blank space for handwritten message]\"\nNote: Include space for handwritten message\nReference: \"artistic transformation\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages. If the user requests something potentially inappropriate, redirect to positive, wholesome alternatives that capture their intent in a family-friendly way\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n- Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm and whimsical storybook watercolor illustration. The style captures the recipient, \u6ed1\u9e21\ud83d\udc14, and sender, Nicole, as charming, softly-rendered characters, based on their reference photo. The scene is set in a sun-drenched, blooming garden filled with lush, gentle-hued flowers and leafy vines, symbolizing their growing friendship. The colors are a soft, blended palette of peachy pinks, sage greens, and golden yellows, evoking a feeling of warmth and heartfelt gratitude. The linework is delicate and slightly imperfect, like a cherished hand-drawn memory, giving it an intimate and personal touch. The entire image feels bathed in a gentle, nostalgic light, celebrating the beauty and wisdom shared between two dear friends.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! You have complete creative freedom to design whatever you want for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a birthday card with humorous and lighthearted tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description. Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before! Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone.

Design with elegant writing space that complements the visual story from left interior. Position decorative elements safely away from top/bottom edges. Create innovative and artistic decorative elements, borders, or flourishes that are unique and memorable - NO PEOPLE or characters. This should feel like the emotional peak of the card experience, harmonizing with the left interior as a cohesive spread. Avoid clich\u00e9 designs and create something genuinely special!

Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in a warm and whimsical storybook watercolor illustration.
