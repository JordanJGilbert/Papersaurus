    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a charming, flat 2D illustration in a slightly textured, stylized cartoon art style with warm, earthy tones. The scene depicts an outdoor setting with Italianate architecture and a canal in the background. The primary characters are two stylized, animated humans and a chicken, all rendered in a friendly, simplified cartoon style with visible outlines. One character, resembling a young woman with glasses and long dark hair, is seated on a ladder, holding a stack of books. The books are titled \"ADVANCED FRIENDSHIP THEORY,\" \"THE ART OF INSIDE JOKES,\" and \"ADVANCED PUNS 101.\" The other character, a young man with sunglasses and spiky brown hair, is reaching up to take the books, appearing slightly overwhelmed or frustrated. A small, bespectacled chicken is sitting on the ground, engrossed in reading a book. Scattered papers suggest an academic or learning theme. The text \"Happy Birthday to my Favorite Guru!\" is prominently displayed at the top in a playful, bold, handwritten cursive script with a dark outline and a slightly distressed texture, fitting the humorous and lighthearted tone. The color palette includes warm oranges, muted greens, blues for the water, and browns and grays for the architecture and clothing, all contributing to a vintage storybook feel. The overall mood is whimsical, humorous, and celebratory, hinting at a shared learning experience and gratitude between friends.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a \"smart style\" and humorous, lighthearted tone, rendered in a warm and whimsical storybook watercolor illustration. The design is a subtle continuation of the front cover's theme of learning and gratitude, focusing on artistic elements that evoke peaceful closure. The background is a soft gradient from pale beige at the bottom to a muted, pale blue-green at the top, reminiscent of aged paper or a soft sky. Centered towards the left half of the image, there is an open, blank book resting on a simple, stylized wooden stool. A single, elegantly drawn quill feather is positioned as if just used to write in the book, its tip resting on the open page. The linework is delicate and slightly imperfect, suggesting a hand-drawn quality with a touch of vintage charm. The overall color palette is muted, with soft browns for the stool and quill, and whites for the book pages, all set against the gentle gradient background. The composition is clean and uncluttered, with the main elements positioned away from the edges to allow for printing bleed. There is no text visible on the back cover. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is intentionally left completely clear and undecorated to reserve space for a QR code. This design provides a quiet, contemplative resolution to the card's visual narrative, symbolizing the ongoing journey of learning and friendship.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a storybook watercolor illustration style. The scene depicts an open book at the bottom from which a vibrant explosion of abstract, painterly strokes erupts upwards. These strokes are in a dynamic mix of colors including bright yellow, peachy pink, teal, and orange, with some dark pink and black speckles. Floating within this colorful energy are three stylized, adorable cartoon chicks wearing graduation caps, appearing to be joyfully emerging from the book. Scattered around them are musical notes and simple mathematical equations like \"X = -b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac) / 2a\" and \"E=mc¬≤\", symbolizing learning and intellectual growth. The overall composition is energetic, whimsical, and humorous, conveying a sense of knowledge and discovery bursting forth from the pages of a book. The background has a textured, slightly grainy appearance, reminiscent of watercolor paper.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a prominent, off-white, slightly textured rectangular area occupying the majority of the page, intended for handwritten text. The background features a soft watercolor wash, transitioning from a warm, sandy yellow on the left to a muted teal on the right. A delicate, hand-drawn black line, reminiscent of a string of fairy lights, drapes from the upper left corner downwards along the right edge of the message area. This string is adorned with small, vibrantly colored circular light bulbs in pink, yellow, blue, and orange, creating a playful and festive accent. At the top left of the card, nestled near the edge of the watercolor wash, is a simple, black outline sketch of a stack of three books. The overall aesthetic is charming, understated, and whimsical, with a focus on providing ample, clean space for personal messaging while maintaining a visually cohesive and gentle artistic theme. The bottom of the card displays the printed text \"From: Nicole\" in a simple, legible, black sans-serif font, positioned safely within the lower right quadrant."
