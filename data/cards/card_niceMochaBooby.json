For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\nVISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:\n- Same color palette across all sections\n- Consistent lighting/time of day\n- Same artistic techniques and brushwork\n- Recurring visual motifs or symbols (but make them unique and memorable!)\n- Progressive emotional journey from introduction to resolution\n- Front cover: stylized cartoon/illustrated characters if people are needed for the theme\n- Left interior: CREATIVE FREEDOM but NO PEOPLE unless user specifically requested people in their description\n- Right interior: focus on message space with innovative decorative elements (NO PEOPLE)\n- Back cover: simple yet creative decorative design without text or people\n- Use simplified, friendly, charming character design if including people (front cover only)\n- CREATIVITY PRIORITY: Always choose the more innovative, surprising, and memorable option over generic designs\n\nReturn JSON:\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"detailed prompt with story opening elements\",\n  \"backCover\": \"detailed prompt with story conclusion elements\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Create a completely unique and different interpretation for this specific card variant. Use different creative approaches, color schemes, compositions, and artistic elements while maintaining the same core theme and requirements.",

On the left, a character with glasses, dark messy hair, and a wide-eyed, panicked expression is running and wielding a large paintbrush, splattering vibrant blue and orange paint across the upper left of the card. On the right, a character with dark hair pulled into a bun, a serene smile, and eyes closed, is holding a small paintbrush and gently petting a black and white fluffy dog. A three-tiered birthday cake with pastel yellow and pink icing, decorated with delicate patterns, sits to the right of the text. The text \\\"Happy Birthday, Gejhs!\\\" is prominently displayed in the center in a warm, brown, handwritten cursive font. The background features soft watercolor washes in shades of beige, light yellow, and subtle hints of blue and pink, with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds. The overall mood is humorous and energetic, with a cohesive color palette and artistic execution.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, in a complementary watercolor style to the front. The design is a simple yet creative artistic flourish. A large, stylized paintbrush, tipped with a small blob of vibrant red paint, is depicted vertically on the left side of the card. Below the brush, a few soft watercolor splotches in yellow, blue, and pink are scattered, echoing the paint splatters from the front cover. The main decorative elements are focused towards the center and left, with a serene, muted color palette of soft yellows, creams, and subtle pastel hues. The right side and bottom-right corner are intentionally left mostly clear, with a small decorative flourish of watercolor wash in the bottom left to frame the composition. The overall impression is one of quiet artistic resolution and a subtle continuation of the theme without any text or characters.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The background features soft, blended washes of pale yellow, peach, and light blue, creating a gentle, artistic atmosphere. The primary elements are a large, textured brown paintbrush and a smaller, thin paintbrush with a reddish-brown handle, positioned vertically on the left and center of the composition. To the right of the paintbrushes, there is a whimsical swirl of white frosting topped with a bright red cherry. The overall tone is serene and artistic, providing a subtle and aesthetically pleasing conclusion that echoes the creative theme of the card without being overly complex. There is ample clear space on the bottom right, approximately 1 inch square, for a QR code. The artistic elements are concentrated towards the center and left to accommodate this reserved space.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting featuring two art brushes of different sizes positioned vertically, with a larger, fluffier brush on the left and a smaller, finer brush to its right. To the right of the brushes, there is a dollop of swirled white frosting topped with a bright red cherry, evoking a festive dessert. The background is a soft, blended wash of watercolor in warm tones of peach and yellow, with subtle hints of cool blue and grey in the upper left quadrant, creating a gentle, artistic atmosphere. The overall style is flat 2D artwork, with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds characteristic of watercolor. The composition is clean and focused, with ample negative space on the right side of the page, implying it is intended for a message. The artistic elements suggest a continuation of a theme related to creativity and celebration, perhaps hinting at the \"artistic transformation\" mentioned in the original request. The color palette is warm and inviting, with naturalistic tones for the brushes and a vibrant pop of color from the cherry and frosting, all rendered with soft, diffused lighting. The prompt should emphasize the specific arrangement and the watercolor aesthetic.",

The background is a warm, creamy beige with subtle washes of pale yellow and peach, evoking a gentle, celebratory mood. Dominating the left side of the page is a humorous depiction of a character looking panicked, wielding a large paintbrush as if it were a weapon, with a dramatic splash of blue and orange paint erupting from its tip. To the right, another character, with a serene expression and a paintbrush in hand, is gently cradling a fluffy, dark-haired dog, implying a more controlled artistic approach. A whimsical, multi-tiered birthday cake, rendered in soft pastel shades of pink and yellow with decorative icing swirls and dots, is positioned in the upper right quadrant, balanced by the dynamic paint splatter. The overall style is illustrative and charming, with visible watercolor textures, soft brushstrokes, and organic paint bleeds throughout. The characters are stylized and friendly, fitting a humorous and lighthearted tone. The arrangement of these elements leaves ample, clear space in the center of the page for a handwritten message.
