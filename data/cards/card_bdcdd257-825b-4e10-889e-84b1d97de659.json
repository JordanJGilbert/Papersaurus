    "backCover": "A simple and elegant design on a pastel teal background, providing a peaceful conclusion. A single, gracefully curved line, reminiscent of a streamer from the front cover, meanders playfully from the top left towards the center. Along this line, a few scattered pieces of multi-colored confetti are delicately placed, as if settling after the party. The overall effect is minimal, clean, and whimsical, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. The design uses the same color palette as the rest of the card, creating a subtle, artistic, and cohesive final touch.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and dynamic cartoon illustration of two characters, a man (Jacob) and a woman (Sarah), in a flat 2D art style. The man is shown comically attempting to draw on a large canvas with a tiny pencil, looking overwhelmed and sweating with effort. His drawing is a simple, child-like stick figure. In contrast, the woman is joyfully leaping into the air from beside the canvas, radiating energy and fun, with colorful confetti and streamers bursting around her as if she is the source of the celebration. The background is a vibrant, solid pastel teal. Centered in the upper half of the card, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The characters are stylized cartoons with simplified, friendly features, positioned away from the edges.",
    "leftInterior": "An abstract, minimalist design that humorously represents a 'fun-o-meter'. On the left, a small, barely-there bar is labeled 'My Attempt at Fun'. On the right, a giant, vibrant, rainbow-colored bar shoots up to the top of the page, nearly bursting out of the frame, labeled 'Your Actual Fun Level'. The background is a clean, solid pastel teal, matching the rest of the card. The design is simple, clever, and executed with clean lines and bright, cheerful colors, carrying the humorous tone from the front cover.",
    "rightInterior": "The personal message is the centerpiece, written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script with a natural pen-ink feel. The text is framed by an artistic and innovative design: a cartoon blueprint schematic for a 'Party Machine'. The blueprint features whimsical, nonsensical diagrams of gears labeled 'Laughter Generator', pipes labeled 'Good Vibes Distributor', and levers for 'Dance Move Selector', all rendered in fine white lines against the pastel teal background. The handwritten message is neatly placed in a large, clear central area of the blueprint, as if it's the machine's core specification. The text reads: 'Sarah,\\n\\nHappy birthday! I was going to try and create a fun birthday card for you, but then I realized you're already way more fun than anything I could draw. Here's to another year of you being the life of the party and me just trying to keep up!\\n\\nBest,\\nJacob'. The design is smart, humorous, and beautifully integrated with the text, creating a memorable climax to the card's story."
