    "backCover": "A simple and elegant back cover with a deep blue and purple galaxy watercolor wash. A small, single watercolor painting of a floating instant noodle cup is in the upper left corner. The design is clean and leaves the bottom-right corner clear for a QR code, with visible paper texture.",
    "frontCover": "A watercolor painting of a majestic, slightly confused-looking minibernedoodle dog wearing a crown, sitting on a throne made of stacked instant noodle cups. The background is a deep, dramatic galaxy of dark blues, purples, and blacks, sprinkled with gold-leaf-like watercolor stars. The dog embodies 'main character energy'. The words \"Happy Birthday Milo\" are elegantly painted in a shimmering gold watercolor font below the throne. The style features rich, saturated colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on textured paper.",
    "leftInterior": "A watercolor illustration of a hand dramatically presenting a single, glowing piece of corn, as if it's a precious jewel. The background is a chaotic explosion of abstract shapes and lines in blues, purples, and gold, representing 'it has the juice'. The style is both unhinged and strangely beautiful, with soft flowing colors and artistic brush strokes.",
    "rightInterior": "A deep, dark blue watercolor background resembling a night sky, with faint purple nebulas and gold star splatters. The message is centered and painted in a striking, beautiful handwritten cursive script using a shimmering gold watercolor paint: \"Bob, no cap, you actually did the thing. It's giving main character energy and I'm literally screaming, crying, throwing up rn. You absolutely ate and left no crumbs, periodt. Unhinged levels of proud of you, Sam\"."
