BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the unique and unconventional tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

HANDWRITING STYLE: Write the message in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal.

Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters.

Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card, in a vibrant Pop Art style reminiscent of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, featuring bold outlines, flat colors, and halftone dot patterns. The central figure, a jubilant cartoon woman with curly dark hair, glasses, a yellow polka-dot top, and a red skirt, is leaping joyfully in mid-air. She holds a purple briefcase in her left hand and a large artist's paintbrush in her right, with energetic yellow and blue rays radiating from behind her. Below her, a group of diverse, happy cartoon figures are gathered. Two figures on the left are holding a box of donuts, and to their right is a man in a blue shirt. A woman with curly hair and sunglasses, mirroring the style of the main figure but with different clothing, stands next to a smiling older woman with white curly hair. The background depicts an Italian bakery setting, with displays of donuts and pastries visible, a clock on the wall, and a sign reading \"ESPRESSO CAPPUCCINO.\" The greeting \"Congratulations\" is presented in a white speech bubble with a thick black outline, positioned centrally. The overall color palette is bright and energetic, dominated by yellows, blues, reds, and pinks. The mood is overwhelmingly joyful, celebratory, and quirky. The artwork is flat, 2D, and full-bleed.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a Pop Art style. The background is a vibrant, solid hot pink. Scattered across the entire background are numerous small, oval-shaped sprinkles in bright colors: yellow, red, and blue, each with a thick black outline. The composition is clean and focused, with a clear visual space in the bottom right corner intentionally left blank for a QR code. The overall aesthetic is cheerful and minimalistic, evoking a sense of playful celebration with a very simple, yet impactful visual. The colors and sprinkle motif tie back to a celebratory, sweet theme, providing a lighthearted conclusion.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a congratulations greeting card with a bold Pop Art style, inspired by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. The background is a vibrant, energetic yellow, filled with small, subtle teal halftone dots. Dominating the center is a stylized comic book explosion or \"POW!\" graphic, rendered in a creamy off-white speech bubble with sharp, angular points. Inside this bubble, the word \"POW!\" is emblazoned in a thick, impactful sans-serif font, colored in a bright, primary red with a black outline. Emerging from the bottom of the \"POW!\" and swirling upwards are dynamic, ribbon-like forms in contrasting bright blue, hot pink, and a warm orange. These forms are rendered with a textured, almost painterly quality, suggesting movement and energy. Around the central \"POW!\" graphic, sharp, starburst shapes in red and blue radiate outwards, also outlined in black, further emphasizing the explosive, energetic theme. The overall composition is dense with color and movement, creating a visually striking and memorable design. There is no text present on this specific interior page as per the prompt's instructions to focus on the artwork for the left side. The artistic elements are consistent with the Pop Art aesthetic, featuring bold colors, graphic shapes, and a high-contrast feel. The creative choice here is the abstract, swirling forms within the iconic \"POW!\" graphic, making it unique and energetic without being clichÃ©. The color palette is bright and cheerful, fitting the \"fun energetic colorful\" theme.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a bright teal background. Dominating the left side of the page is a large, curved, stylized yellow shape reminiscent of a palette or a large, abstract brush stroke, filled with various colorful circular elements. These circles contain bold patterns: one with scattered small red dots, another with larger red dots, one with a turquoise chevron pattern, one with pink and white diagonal stripes, and a bottom one with a blue zigzag lightning bolt pattern. The entire design is rendered in a bold Pop Art style, inspired by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, featuring flat colors, strong black outlines, and graphic design aesthetics. The message text, \"Teresa, Heard your big news surprised retirement. I can't believe you beat me to retirement and it looks like youâ€™ve officially collected enough awesome work points to level up in Life! Your world is about to get even more freedom to make a more colorful Life and I can't wait to see the masterpiece you create. So proud of you, sis! To tell you the truth, I'm just jealous of your new freedom - Your brother, John\", is elegantly handwritten in a flowing, dark cursive script across the right two-thirds of the card, with ample spacing around the text to ensure legibility and a clean presentation against the vibrant background. The script is warm, personal, and easy to read, with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight, fitting within the safe printing margins. The overall composition is energetic, colorful, and unique, fulfilling the quirky and fun theme."
