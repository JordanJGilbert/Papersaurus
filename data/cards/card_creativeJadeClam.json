    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a get-well greeting card, in a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a split scene depicting the contrasting states of struggle and past resilience. The left side of the image is dominated by a deep, velvety blue background, transitioning into stylized, billowing clouds that evoke a starry night sky. These clouds are filled with numerous small white dots and brighter, four-pointed starbursts, suggesting a hopeful, luminous presence. The texture of the clouds has a subtle, slightly rough paper-like quality. Emerging from the center right of these blue clouds is a wispy trail of bright, white light, speckled with tiny, star-like points. This light stream gracefully curves and connects towards the right side of the image, where it encounters a mass of dark, textured, stormy clouds. These clouds are rendered in varying shades of deep grey and charcoal, with soft, scalloped edges. The light stream appears to be gently pushing against or interacting with these dark clouds, with a few small, white star-like glimmers visible where they meet. The overall impression is one of a gentle, yet powerful, flow of light and hope breaking through darkness and struggle. The style is flat 2D illustration with a subtle watercolor texture, and the composition is abstract and evocative, conveying emotion through color and form rather than literal representation. The color palette is limited to deep blues, dark greys, and whites, creating a dramatic yet serene atmosphere.",

You've navigated heartache and overcome immense challenges, and you have that same incredible resilience within you now. Hold on tight, because I know for a fact that you will get through this, too. All my love, Rana,\" is rendered in a flowing, legible cursive script with a slight calligraphic flair, in a bright white color that stands out against the dark background. The overall style is reminiscent of a gentle watercolor wash for the clouds and a crisp, clean line for the text, creating a heartfelt and serene atmosphere. The stars are small, delicate white specks and larger, stylized starbursts scattered across the sky. The composition prioritizes readability and emotional impact, with the text occupying the majority of the central space, ensuring no decorative elements distract from the heartfelt message. The artistic style is consistent with a soft, illustrative aesthetic."
