    "backCover": "A minimalist watercolor design continuing the celestial theme. A single, delicate gold shooting star with a softly glowing tail arcs gracefully across a serene lavender and rose-pink watercolor wash background, moving from the upper left towards the center. The star leaves a subtle trail of shimmering paint flecks. The overall feel is quiet, peaceful, and magical, providing a gentle conclusion to the card's story. The bottom-right corner is left plain against the soft watercolor wash, clear of any decorative elements.",
    "frontCover": "A romantic watercolor painting of a charming cartoon-style couple, representing Jason and Sarah, sitting on a crescent moon that hangs in a soft lavender and rose-pink twilight sky. Stars around them are subtly shaped like tiny hearts. The couple is seen from the back, holding hands, looking out at the dreamy star-filled expanse. Below them, floating in the center of the card, is the text \"Happy Birthday, my love\" written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is soft and flowing, with artistic brush strokes, delicate paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, creating a magical and intimate atmosphere.",
    "leftInterior": "An abstract watercolor masterpiece representing a 'constellation of our memories.' Luminous gold and silver lines connect shimmering, soft-focus dots of various sizes against a deep indigo and magenta watercolor wash, reminiscent of a nebula. Some dots subtly bloom into tiny, abstract floral shapes, like star-flowers. The composition is dynamic yet ethereal, evoking a sense of shared history and beautiful moments woven together across a personal galaxy. The style is fluid and dreamy, with soft bleeds and delicate paint splatters creating a sense of wonder and depth.",
    "rightInterior": "A stunning watercolor illustration where the romantic message is framed by an elegant, innovative design. Two delicate, intertwined watercolor ribbons, one in lavender and one in rose-pink, flow gracefully from the top left and bottom right corners, swirling towards the center to create a soft, heart-like frame. Where the ribbons meet and overlap, they blend into a beautiful magenta hue, adorned with tiny, glowing stardust specks. The message is beautifully written in the center within this frame in a legible, flowing, warm handwritten cursive script: \"Sarah,\\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I realized I didn't want to be reminded that I'm right there with you. Hope you have a fantastic day!\\n- Jason\" The background is a soft, pale cream with gentle watercolor paper texture."
