    "frontCover": "Here is the prompt for the front cover:\n\nFront cover of a greeting card with a vibrant, comic-book-inspired illustration. The artistic style is flat, bold, and graphic, with clean lines and a limited, high-contrast color palette. The background features a dynamic rayburst pattern in alternating thick bands of bright yellow, electric blue, and hot pink against a creamy off-white base. Dominating the center is a cheerful, stylized cartoon woman with auburn hair, depicted with a wide smile and a thumbs-up gesture. She wears a light grey camouflage-patterned shirt and light tan pants, with grey boots. She holds a small, festive birthday cake adorned with white frosting, blueberries, and a lit candle on a white plate. To the left of the woman, a simplified representation of the Earth is visible, suggesting travel. Below the Earth and to the left of the woman is a vintage computer monitor displaying a yellow \"SYSTEM ERROR!\" bubble and a blue \"PASSWORD RESET!\" screen, both rendered in a dramatic, starburst-like effect. To the right of the woman, a stylized classical building with columns, resembling a bank, is depicted with some of its facade broken and scattered around its base, hinting at a departure from the past. The text \"HAPPY RETIREMENT TERESA!\" is prominently displayed at the top in a bold, comic-style font with a red outline and a yellow fill, set within a red starburst speech bubble. The overall mood is energetic, celebratory, and humorous, conveying a clear message of leaving a demanding job for fun and freedom.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a retirement greeting card, in a flat, bold, illustrative style with clean lines and a limited, vibrant color palette. The background is a solid, cheerful sky blue. Centered at the top, a large, stylized heart-shape representing the globe is depicted, complete with continents outlined in black and colored green and blue. This heart-globe is suspended by a simple black hook, and draped behind it, cascading downwards, is a bright red superhero cape. This imagery symbolizes a grand, heroic transition into a new phase of life. Below this central element, on a flat, deep blue surface, are two white ceramic mugs. The mug on the left has \"MOM\" printed in bold, black sans-serif text, and the mug on the right has \"TERESA\" printed in the same style. The mugs are positioned side-by-side, close together. In front of the mugs, slightly overlapping the right mug and angled towards the viewer, is a folded map, depicted with a grid of blue and green squares, hinting at travel and destinations. The overall composition is simple, direct, and symbolic, conveying themes of love, adventure, and celebration. There is no space reserved for a QR code.",

    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, pop-art style. The background is a bright, radiating yellow burst, reminiscent of comic book sound effects, on a white cardstock base.

To its right, a simple, bright blue airplane with a white dotted trail is depicted in flight, also outlined in black. These elements are placed against red and blue circular backgrounds respectively, which are then set against the yellow burst. In the bottom left, a martini glass filled with a red, bubbly liquid and garnished with a green lime slice is shown, again against a blue circular background. To its right, a pair of bright yellow flip-flops with blue straps are illustrated, set against an orange circular background. All these illustrative elements are rendered in a flat, two-dimensional style with bold, clean lines and minimal shading, characteristic of vintage comic book art. The color palette is bright and primary, emphasizing a fun, celebratory, and slightly retro feel. The overall composition effectively balances the printed message with iconic imagery representing travel and relaxation, leaving significant negative space for personalization."
