You're officially a quarter of a century old, which means your car insurance is about to get cheaper and your back is about to get achey-er. Don't worry, I'll be there to help you with all the old people stuff.\n\nLove you more than anything,\nJordan\"\n\nReference: \"make us cute cartoon\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n- Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in the style of a vintage, retro-futuristic comic book cover from the 1960s. The illustration should feature bold, black ink outlines with a slightly distressed, off-register feel, mimicking old printing techniques. The color palette is vibrant but limited, using saturated teals, sun-faded oranges, mustard yellows, and creamy whites, all applied with a Ben-Day dot pattern for shading and texture. The central image, a stylized and heroic caricature of \"Lao Lao\" based on her photo, portrays her as a glamorous space adventurer. She's depicted striking a dynamic, confident pose, perhaps holding a ray gun that shoots confetti, with a wry, knowing smirk. The background is a simplified, graphic representation of a fantastical planet or cityscape, with bubble-domed buildings and flying saucers. The number \"25\" is a massive, explosive graphic element integrated into the scene, rendered in a bold, sans-serif typeface with a dramatic drop shadow. Speech bubbles with hand-lettered, slightly quirky text can add to the humor, with exclamations like \"By Jove! She's 25!\" or \"The Astonishing Lao Lao Enters Her Twenty-Fifth Orbit!\". The overall mood is playful, action-packed, and affectionately nostalgic, celebrating her milestone birthday with epic, humorous grandeur.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! The AI has complete creative freedom to design whatever it wants for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a birthday card with humorous and lighthearted tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description. Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before! Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, in a vibrant and friendly cartoon illustration style. The scene depicts a futuristic laboratory or workshop. On the left, a person in a white lab coat, with dark hair pulled back in a bun, is beaming with joy and holding up a small, cute, blue and gray robot with antenna, round eyes, and a screen for a face. This robot is waving enthusiastically. To the right, a person with dark, spiky hair, wearing a dark hoodie, gives a thumbs-up, also smiling broadly. In the foreground, on the left, a small, somewhat beat-up-looking robot with \"X\" marks for eyes and smoke coming out of its head, sits on the floor. The background features glowing blue panels with circuit board patterns and a stylized outline of a humanoid robot on a large screen. The lighting is bright and cheerful, with hints of pink and purple neon glow from the background. The text \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my favorite upgrade!\" is prominently displayed in the lower-middle section of the card, in a bold, rounded, sans-serif font with a dark outline and a light yellow fill. The overall mood is humorous, celebratory, and tech-themed, with a playful and endearing aesthetic.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist, futuristic aesthetic, continuing the theme from the previous panels. The overall style is clean, sleek, and modern, using a monochromatic color palette dominated by deep blues and subtle cool grays, with a soft, diffused lighting that creates a sense of depth and sophistication. The composition features a single, elegantly rendered robotic arm, possibly the same one from the front cover, extending from the upper right corner. Its articulated fingers gently hold the base of a single, slender candle that is lit with a warm, glowing flame, positioned centrally towards the bottom of the image. The candle is embedded in a simplified, geometric cupcake topped with smooth, stylized frosting, presented on a minimalist, cubic pedestal. The background is a dark, deep blue, with subtle, horizontal light streaks or subtle panel lines that suggest advanced technology or a futuristic environment, adding to the overall sleekness. There are no visible text elements or QR code spaces, allowing the minimalist imagery to provide a quiet, thoughtful conclusion to the card's narrative. The design emphasizes simplicity and elegance, providing a sense of calm resolution.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a blueprint-style illustration, set against a dark navy blue background with a subtle grid overlay. The central focus is a stylized, friendly robot depicted in a chalk-like outline of a luminous lavender color. The robot is presented as a technical schematic, with various labels pointing to its features. These labels include \"UPGRADED SNACK-FETCHING MODULE,\" \"ADVANCED COMPLIMENT GENERATOR,\" and \"INFINITE CUDDLE CAPACITY.\" A small, simplified robot drawing is positioned in the upper right corner, mirroring the main robot's design. Below the main robot, a rectangular text box contains the humorous warning, \"CAUTION: MAY STEAL ALL THE BLANKETS.\" Numerous small, playful design elements, such as scattered dots, swirls, asterisks, and circular arrows, are scattered throughout the blueprint, adding to the whimsical and technical aesthetic. The overall style is flat 2D artwork, with bold, clean lines and a limited color palette of dark blue and luminous lavender, creating a cohesive and humorous visual narrative that is both charming and slightly quirky, perfect for a funny birthday card.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a holographic, futuristic interface. The central area is dedicated to the message: \"Happy 25th birthday, Lao Lao! You're officially a quarter of a century old, which means your car insurance is about to get cheaper and your back is about to get achey-er. Don't worry, I'll be there to help you with all the old people stuff. Love you more than anything, Jordan\". This text is presented in a clean, modern, sans-serif font, glowing with a vibrant cyan light against a deep blue, slightly blurred background that hints at a technological environment. The text is contained within a stylized, glowing holographic frame, reminiscent of a futuristic HUD (Heads-Up Display). This frame features sharp, geometric lines with small circular nodes and subtle circuit-like patterns. The overall design emphasizes a clean, digital aesthetic with glowing neon lines defining the message space. The colors are primarily deep blues and bright cyan, creating a sense of advanced technology and a slightly ethereal glow. There are no decorative borders or flourishes in the traditional sense; the holographic frame itself serves as the primary decorative and functional element, clearly delineating the message area while reinforcing the futuristic theme. The composition is centered, with ample negative space around the text to allow for potential handwritten additions if this were a physical card, though the prompt focuses on the printed design. The artistic style is distinctly sci-fi, with a focus on light and digital interfaces rather than organic or traditional decorative elements."
