    "backCover": "A minimalist and artistic design on a soft pastel yellow background, providing peaceful closure. In the center-left area, a single, elegantly drawn cartoon lightning bolt is depicted, glowing softly with the same pink and teal energy seen on the front cover. A few whimsical sparkles float gently around it, echoing the energy trail from the front. The design is simple, clean, and subtly whimsical, referencing the 'energy' theme of the card in a quiet, artistic way. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated.",
    "frontCover": "A vibrant and funny cartoon illustration in a flat 2D style. In the center, a charming cartoon grandmother with short, stylish white hair and glasses looks comically drained, with a low-battery symbol floating above her head. Beside her, an energetic cartoon toddler with bright, happy eyes and pigtails is depicted mid-zoom, leaving a sparkling trail of energy behind her. A glowing, whimsical energy cord connects from the grandmother's battery symbol to the toddler, as if the toddler is recharging from her. The background is a soft, cheerful pastel yellow with subtle confetti details. In the center, above the characters, the text \"Happy Shared Birthday!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is playful and smart, with clean lines and a warm, inviting color palette of yellows, soft pinks, and teals.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "A creative and funny 'energy transfer' diagram illustration in a flat 2D vector art style, set against a soft pastel yellow background. On the left side of the page is a large, stylized cartoon battery icon labeled 'Grandma's Energy Reserve,' shown at about 20% full. On the right side of the page is a smaller, comically oversized battery icon labeled 'Toddler Shenanigan Fuel,' shown at 150% full and overflowing with crackling pink and teal energy sparks. A thick, whimsical, spiraling power cord connects the two batteries, clearly showing the direction of energy flow from the 'Grandma' battery to the 'Toddler' battery. The diagram includes funny, tiny labels with arrows pointing to the toddler battery, such as 'For Running in Circles,' 'For Unexplained Screaming,' and 'For Snack Demands.' The style is clean, humorous, and visually consistent with the rest of the card.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and artistic design framing the message. The handwritten message is centered on a soft pastel yellow background. The text is written in an elegant, flowing, and clearly readable cursive script with a natural pen-like appearance. The message is framed by a whimsical border made of intertwined, glowing energy cords in soft pink and teal, which spiral gracefully around the text area. The cords occasionally emit small, glowing sparkles that drift towards the corners of the page, creating a sense of magic and joy. The overall design is sophisticated yet playful, perfectly complementing the humorous theme while beautifully presenting the heartfelt message. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! It's pretty amazing that you and Vivi share a birthday, although we suspect she's stealing all your energy to power her toddler shenanigans. We hope your special day is filled with as much joy as you bring to all of us! Love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\"."
