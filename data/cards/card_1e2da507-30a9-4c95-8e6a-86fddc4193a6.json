    "backCover": "A minimalist Pop Art design bringing the card's story to a peaceful close. The background is a solid, vibrant magenta, covered in a subtle pattern of darker magenta halftone dots. A stylized graphic of two intertwined gold wedding rings, rendered with bold black outlines and a shiny comic book effect, is featured in the upper-left quadrant. A few graphic-style white olive leaves float gently around the rings. The design is simple, elegant, and uses the same bold lines and color palette from the front cover. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty.",
    "frontCover": "A Pop Art wedding card in the style of Roy Lichtenstein. A vibrant cartoon couple stands before a stylized Greek Orthodox church with iconic blue domes in Agrinio, Greece. The background is a bright, sunny yellow with bold halftone dots. The groom, a cartoon man with black hair and sunglasses, smiles broadly. The bride, a cartoon woman in a flowing white dress, looks lovingly at him. Beside them, a little cartoon boy in a tiny suit holds a ring pillow, and a little cartoon girl in a frilly dress scatters graphic-style flower petals. The scene is framed with bold, black comic book lines. The color palette is energetic: cerulean blue, sunshine yellow, and vibrant magenta. In the center, the text \"Congratulations on Your Wedding\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, black handwritten cursive script.

    "leftInterior": "An explosive Pop Art composition celebrating the journey from New York to Greece. A stylized, graphic map shows a bold, dotted line arching from a pop art rendition of the New York skyline (represented by a simplified skyscraper) to a pop art depiction of the Parthenon in Greece. The background is split diagonally: one half is a pattern of blue and white Greek key motifs, the other half is a field of vibrant yellow with bold black outlines. At the center where the two backgrounds meet, a large, graphic heart in magenta with halftone dot shading radiates energy lines, symbolizing the love that connects the two places. The overall design is dynamic, colorful, and abstract, using the card's signature cerulean blue, magenta, and yellow palette.",
    "rightInterior": "A stunning Pop Art design framing the wedding message. A large, stylized white olive tree branch, rendered with thick black comic-book outlines, sweeps gracefully from the top left corner down towards the bottom right. The leaves are a vibrant cerulean blue with halftone dot shading. Interspersed among the leaves are small, graphic hearts in bright magenta. This decorative element frames a clean, white central area where the message is beautifully written. The background is a solid, sunny yellow. The message reads: \"Dearest Michael and Alexis,\n\nYour beautiful family from Smithtown traveled all the way to this incredible day in Greece. Your love story is an inspiration, and we are so honored to celebrate with you as you begin this new chapter together. May your life be as vibrant, joyful, and full of love as your wedding day!\n\nAll our love,\nThe Gilbert Family\" in an elegant, legible, black handwritten cursive script with a natural, warm feel."
