    "backCover": "A minimal and serene back cover design in a beautiful watercolor painting style, visually cohesive with the front cover. The artwork features a soft, watercolor-washed evening sky, echoing the background of the front cover. A single, stylized firework bursts gently in the top-center of the image, with soft trails of light fading into the background. The design is simple and elegant, using the same color palette of deep blues, purples, and vibrant firework colors. The image has a subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds. IMPORTANT: The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, must be left completely clear of any illustration or heavy color wash, reserved for a QR code.",
    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a funny and romantic scene for a greeting card front cover, in a beautiful watercolor painting style.\n\nCreate stylized cartoon characters of Jordan and Lao Lao based on the provided reference photo. Jordan is laughing with his eyes closed, while Lao Lao has a comically terrified, wide-eyed expression. They are sitting side-by-side in the front car of a giant, whimsical rollercoaster at Great America amusement park.\n\nIn the background, a vibrant Fourth of July fireworks display explodes across a soft, watercolor-washed evening sky. The rollercoaster track twists and turns fancifully around them.\n\nThe overall style should be lighthearted and humorous, capturing a cherished, funny memory. The artwork should feature soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds characteristic of watercolor.\n\nIn the center of the image, written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Thank you for the wild ride\".\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS - ONLY INCLUDE WHAT IS ACTUALLY VISIBLE:\n- REPRESENT ONLY PEOPLE ACTUALLY IN THE PHOTOS: Create cartoon versions of ONLY the people who are actually shown in the reference photos. Do NOT add, create, or imagine any additional people not present in the reference images.\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo - only what is actually visible\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone - exactly as shown in the reference\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate ONLY the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles actually worn by each person in their reference photo - do not add or change any clothing items\n- ACCESSORIES ONLY IF VISIBLE: Include accessories (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.) ONLY if they are actually visible on each person in the reference photo.

Only include people, clothing, and accessories that are clearly shown in the reference images.\n\nStudy every detail of the people actually in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features. The characters must be immediately recognizable as the same people from the reference photo. Pay special attention to clothing details and accessories that are actually visible, and unique personal style elements that make each person distinctive. Do not add or imagine any elements not present in the reference.\n\nThe cartoon style should be charming and artistic while preserving complete visual accuracy to the reference photo. Only represent people, clothing, and accessories that are actually visible in the reference images.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, decorative left interior page for a greeting card, continuing the watercolor theme from the front cover. This full-bleed artwork features an abstract pattern of whimsical, looping rollercoaster tracks rendered in soft, flowing watercolor lines. The tracks twist and turn gracefully across the page against a soft, muted evening sky backdrop. Interspersed between the tracks are small, subtle starbursts and sparkles, reminiscent of the Fourth of July fireworks. The style is artistic and elegant, with visible brush strokes, a delicate paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. No people or text.",
    "rightInterior": "An elegant right interior page design that integrates a personal message into decorative artwork. The background is a soft, light watercolor wash that matches the evening sky from the front cover. A delicate, whimsical rollercoaster track, rendered in watercolor, elegantly frames the top and bottom of the page. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Lao Lao, thanks for an amazing summer! I'm still not sure what was more explosive, the Fourth of July fireworks or my stomach after all those rollercoasters at the amusement park. Honestly, surviving both with you officially makes you the best girlfriend ever.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\". Small, soft watercolor sparkles are scattered tastefully around the text. The overall design is clean and romantic, maintaining the artistic watercolor style with visible brush strokes and a subtle paper texture. No people or characters."
