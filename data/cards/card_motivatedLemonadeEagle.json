    "frontCover": "A charming and funny watercolor painting of a slightly frazzled, cartoon-style sloth wearing a festive party hat, hilariously attempting to blow out a single, stubbornly lit birthday candle on a tiny cupcake it's holding. The sloth has a look of comical concentration, with its cheeks puffed out. Soft, flowing watercolor washes in shades of green, brown, and pastel party colors create the scene, with artistic brush strokes and organic paint bleeds on a visible paper texture. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy belated... I mean, timely... Birthday\". Flat 2D artwork.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene full-bleed watercolor background. The design features a gentle wash of soft pastel greens and creams, echoing the front cover's palette, with visible paper texture and subtle, organic paint bleeds. A few delicate, stylized green leaves, painted in the same soft watercolor style, drift gracefully from the top-left corner towards the center. The overall composition is peaceful and uncluttered. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1-inch square, is intentionally left completely blank and free of any artistic elements for QR code placement. Flat 2D artwork.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful full-bleed decorative watercolor painting that continues the theme from the front cover. The design features an abstract pattern of intertwined, stylized tropical vines and leaves, rendered in soft, flowing washes of green, brown, and subtle pastel party colors. The artwork is characterized by artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a visible paper texture, creating a harmonious and cohesive feel with the rest of the card. The composition is elegant and artistic, with no characters or text. Flat 2D artwork.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful full-bleed watercolor background with visible paper texture, featuring soft washes of pastel green and cream that create a light and airy feel. Delicate, stylized green watercolor leaves and subtle pastel confetti shapes frame the top-left and bottom-right corners, enhancing the message without overwhelming it. In the center, perfectly integrated with the artwork, is the message written in a beautiful, highly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script with high contrast against the background. The text is: \"John,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered I have to see you every day and I value my safety. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\n\nAll the best,\nLauren\". The text is positioned safely away from all edges for maximum legibility. Flat 2D artwork."
