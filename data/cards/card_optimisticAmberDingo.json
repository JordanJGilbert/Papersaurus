The artwork is in the style of classic 1950 Disney animation with romantic realism, set against the backdrop of San Francisco. The style is Art Deco, exuding an elegant and sophisticated tone. The image features a blond female civil engineer, depicted in a characteristic 1950s double-breasted trench coat in a warm tan color. She is holding a rolled-up diploma or blueprint, tied with a golden ribbon, with a contented expression and closed eyes. The background shows the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, illuminated at dusk, with the sky transitioning from deep purple to a lighter hue, sprinkled with stars. The water in the foreground reflects the bridge's lights. A dark railing separates the foreground from the water. The entire image is framed by a dark blue border with intricate Art Deco gold geometric patterns, reminiscent of stylized arches and sunbursts. The overall color palette is warm and rich, with dominant tones of tan, gold, deep blue, and muted purples. The artistic technique suggests flat 2D illustration with subtle shading and clean lines, creating a polished, vintage feel. Text: \\\"Happy Birthday\\\" is subtly placed in the lower center of the image, rendered in a flowing, elegant handwritten cursive script, in a gold color that complements the border and ribbon.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a sophisticated and refined Art Deco style. The background is a solid, muted lavender color. Dominating the left side of the image is a stylized, geometric floral motif rendered in a striking combination of deep navy blue and metallic gold. The flower itself has sharp, angular petals, with segments filled in alternating navy and gold. A thin, curved stem extends downwards, featuring two stylized, sharp-edged leaves in navy with gold outlines. Emanating from the top of the flower are thin, radiating gold lines, creating a sunburst or halo effect. These lines are strategically placed to extend towards the upper right quadrant of the card, leaving the majority of the right side of the card blank. This blank space is likely intended for a QR code or other minimal publisher information, adhering to the requirement for a clear bottom-right corner. The overall composition is clean, elegant, and serves as a subtle, artistic conclusion to the visual narrative, referencing the style and color palette established in previous sections without being overtly detailed. No text is present.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a sophisticated and refined Art Deco style. The background is a deep, rich navy blue, overlaid with a complex geometric network of thin, elegant gold lines that suggest an abstract cityscape or map. Within this grid, stylized shapes of teal or deep emerald green are strategically placed. On the left, a tall, rectangular structure with a rounded top, reminiscent of a stylized lighthouse or Art Deco building, is outlined in gold and filled with teal. To the right and slightly behind this structure, a large, sharp, triangular teal shape rises, bordered by gold lines, suggesting a mountain or a prominent building. The overall composition is abstract, utilizing bold geometric forms and a limited, sophisticated color palette of deep navy, gold, and teal to create a sense of depth and architectural elegance. The design is flat, 2D artwork with full-bleed background elements, characteristic of vintage Art Deco prints.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with \"Leila in San Francisco\" elegantly scripted in a refined, flowing cursive font. The background is a soft, creamy ivory. The central focus is a stylized, multi-tiered fountain rendered in deep navy blue with prominent gold accents, suggesting classic Art Deco design. This fountain is intricately detailed, with radiating lines and geometric elements. Above the fountain, a decorative, fan-like motif in the same navy and gold palette emanates upwards, framing the top of the text. Beneath the fountain, a series of elegant, curving lines in navy and gold mimic flowing water or stylized waves, creating a dynamic visual base. The entire design is enclosed within a strong Art Deco border featuring thick navy lines with thin gold inlays, and distinctive geometric corner accents in gold and navy. The overall aesthetic is sophisticated, elegant, and reminiscent of vintage glamour."
