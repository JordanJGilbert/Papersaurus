    "backCover": "A simple yet innovative pop art design providing a peaceful conclusion. The design features a stylized, oversized Greek olive branch rendered with bold outlines and a limited color palette of cobalt blue, white, and a touch of gold. The branch is positioned on the left and center, with its leaves showing subtle Ben-Day dot patterns. The background is a solid, sunny yellow, creating a serene and minimalist feel. This design subtly references the Greek theme from the front cover in a quiet, artistic way. The bottom-right corner area is left completely empty and undecorated. The overall composition is balanced, clean, and feels like a calm, memorable ending to the card's energetic story.",
    "frontCover": "A vibrant pop art style illustration celebrating a wedding. A stylized cartoon couple, the groom with dark hair and sunglasses, and the bride in a flowing white dress, stand joyfully with their two young children, a little boy as a ring bearer and a little girl as a flower girl. They are set against a dynamic, colorful backdrop of Agrinio, Greece, with simplified Greek architecture and bougainvillea flowers. The scene is infused with pop art elements: bold primary colors like electric blue, sunshine yellow, and hot pink, thick black outlines, and prominent Ben-Day dots. In the center, the text 'Congratulations Michael & Alexis' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script.

    "leftInterior": "An imaginative pop art masterpiece. A split-panel graphic design, inspired by Roy Lichtenstein, contrasts two iconic locations. The left panel depicts a stylized, pop art version of the Smithtown, New York skyline, using cool blues, grays, and bold black lines. The right panel shows a vibrant, sun-drenched scene of Agrinio, Greece, with its characteristic architecture in bright yellows, oranges, and turquoise. A thick, expressive 'POW!' or 'ZAP!'-style comic book graphic connects the two panels, symbolizing the energetic journey and connection between their home and their wedding destination. The entire image is filled with halftone dots and dynamic lines, creating a visually stunning and unexpected piece of art that tells a story without characters.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed space for the wedding message, rendered in a pop art style. The handwritten message is the central focus, written in an elegant, legible cursive script that feels personal and warm. The message reads: 'Dearest Michael and Alexis,\\n\\nYour beautiful family from Smithtown traveled all the way to this incredible day in Greece. Your love story is an inspiration, and we are so honored to celebrate with you as you begin this new chapter together. May your life be as vibrant, joyful, and full of love as your wedding day!\\n\\nAll our love,\\nThe Gilbert Family'. The text is framed by an artistic explosion of abstract pop art hearts and stylized olive leaves, bursting from the corners in bright pinks, reds, and vibrant greens. The design uses bold outlines and Ben-Day dots to integrate seamlessly with the overall card aesthetic, creating an emotional climax that is both visually exciting and deeply romantic."
