I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features.

The scene depicts a vibrant, cheerful beach with soft, turquoise waves lapping at a sandy shore. A personalized character, joyfully transformed from her photo, is relaxing in a beach chair under a colorful umbrella, trading her computer mouse for a tropical drink. The illustration is filled with hand-drawn details: little illustrated passport stamps and travel icons playfully scattered in the sand, and a small, forgotten keyboard being overtaken by beautiful, blooming hibiscus flowers. The overall feeling is painterly and organic, with visible, soft textures and a bright, celebratory color palette that radiates happiness, freedom, and the promise of wonderful new adventures.\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals.

    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a retirement greeting card with a vibrant, graphic illustration in a bold, retro comic book style. The color palette is dominated by a striking contrast of warm oranges, yellows, and reds against cooler blues and greens, with black outlines defining all elements. The text \\\"RETIRMENT: LEVEL UP!\\\" is prominently displayed in large, yellow, blocky, sans-serif font with a red outline, positioned in the upper right quadrant of the card. The composition is split-style: the left side features a grayscale, half-tone dot pattern background, with a character in a headset and glasses, looking stressed and surrounded by binary code (0s and 1s), symbolizing the previous work life. This character appears to be glitching or breaking apart. On the right side, a dynamic, energetic cartoon woman in a red tank top and teal leggings is mid-leap, bursting out of a pixelated computer screen. Her expression is joyful and triumphant, fist raised. The screen she is emerging from reveals a bright, sunny beach scene with a blue ocean and a golden sun, hinting at future adventures. Below the screen, three other jubilant cartoon characters are depicted running or walking on a wooden boardwalk surrounded by lush green foliage, all with expressions of excitement and happiness. The overall mood is humorous, celebratory, and depicts a clear transition from a tech-focused work environment to a more active, outdoor, and fulfilling retirement. The artistic technique uses flat colors with visible texture overlays to emulate a printed comic feel.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a retirement greeting card featuring a simplified, stylized continuation of the front cover's theme in a retro comic book illustration style with a warm color palette. The design is primarily composed of playful, abstract geometric shapes and iconic elements from the front cover, rendered with a similar graphic sensibility and color scheme of oranges, yellows, and blues. Scattered across the background are subtle, small, repeating motifs of \\\"01\\\" binary code and simplified palm trees or sun shapes, reminiscent of the beach scene. There are no people or text on this back cover. The arrangement of these elements creates a sense of peaceful departure and happy anticipation, offering a clean, decorative conclusion that complements the energetic front cover without being overly complex. The visual focus is on decorative patterns and subtle thematic callbacks.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Prompt for a 9:16 ratio greeting card front cover: A stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by a warm and sunny gouache and colored pencil illustration style, depicting a vibrant, cheerful beach scene with soft turquoise waves. The character, embodying the joy of retirement, is relaxing in a beach chair under a colorful umbrella, holding a tropical drink in one hand and a computer mouse in the other, symbolizing a transition from work to leisure. The illustration is rich with hand-drawn details: subtle passport stamps and travel icons are playfully scattered in the sand. A small, stylized computer keyboard is partially submerged in the sand, with beautiful, blooming hibiscus flowers growing over it, representing nature reclaiming technology. The overall feeling is painterly and organic, with visible soft textures, a bright and celebratory color palette of warm yellows, blues, and greens, radiating happiness, freedom, and new adventures.

The composition is minimalistic and serene, focusing on the symbolic transition. Centered on the warm yellow background, a stylized, simplified palm tree with lush green fronds is depicted. The trunk of the palm tree curves elegantly, and a thin, green cord extends from its base, subtly transforming into the cable of a classic, light-yellow computer mouse. Above the palm tree, a small, abstract, orange heart shape is placed, symbolizing love and well-being. The overall aesthetic is flat 2D artwork with bold, clean outlines and a slightly textured, grainy overlay reminiscent of colored pencil work. The color palette is consistent with the front cover, featuring warm yellows, greens, and touches of orange. There are no people or text on the back cover, providing a peaceful and artistic closure that hints at the carefree, tropical future of retirement, with the computer mouse subtly integrated as a nod to the past.\"\n}\n```",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a retirement greeting card with a bright, textured yellow background. Dominating the left side of the image is a stylized, simplified illustration of a computer mouse, rendered in a light yellow with bold black outlines. A thin, dark green, curved cord extends from the mouse upwards, transforming into the trunk and stalk of a palm tree. The palm tree's fronds are depicted in a deep green, with thick, black outlines, suggesting a playful, almost graphic-novel-like quality. At the very top of the palm tree, a small, stylized heart shape is outlined in black and filled with a vibrant, warm orange. The overall artistic style is flat, 2D, with a subtle dot-patterned texture overlaying the entire image, particularly noticeable in the background and on the mouse.

    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a retirement greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, cartoon-style illustration. The left side of the page features a stark, monochromatic visual of a stressed computer support worker, complete with headset and glasses, surrounded by binary code and a pixelated grid. This section subtly breaks away into colorful, geometric shards, transitioning into the main illustration. The right side of the page explodes with color and activity: a jubilant, athletic woman in a bright orange tank top and teal capri pants leaps joyfully, bursting forth from a shattered computer monitor. Behind her, a tropical beach scene with a bright sun and turquoise water is visible through the broken screen. Below this, three smiling, diverse cartoon characters in athletic wear are running along a wooden boardwalk surrounded by lush green foliage. The overall art style is bold and graphic, with strong outlines and flat colors, reminiscent of retro comic books or vintage animation. The color palette is warm and energetic, with dominant yellows, oranges, blues, and greens, conveying a sense of freedom and celebration. This entire design creates a clear visual narrative of transitioning from the structured, digital world of computer support to the liberating, active, and sunny world of retirement. There is no explicit text printed on this interior page, leaving ample space for a handwritten message."
