For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements.

I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections.

Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before! Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone. Style: in dreamy fantasy anime style, with soft pastels, magical atmosphere, detailed nature elements, whimsical characters, and enchanting fairy-tale qualities\n\n3. Right Interior (Story Climax): BE CREATIVE WITH MESSAGE DESIGN! Include message text: \"Retirement congratulations have fun beach travel golf  exercise \" positioned safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image) integrated into beautiful, innovative decorative artwork. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the message - NO PEOPLE or characters. This should feel like the emotional peak of the card experience, harmonizing with the left interior as a cohesive spread. Avoid clich\u00e9 designs and create something genuinely special! Style: in dreamy fantasy anime style, with soft pastels, magical atmosphere, detailed nature elements, whimsical characters, and enchanting fairy-tale qualities\n\n4. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity.
