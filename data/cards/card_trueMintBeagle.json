    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a stylized, flat 2D cartoon illustration. The art style is reminiscent of anime with soft pastel colors and a dreamy, magical atmosphere. The main subject is a joyful, energetic woman leaping in mid-air with her arms outstretched, her hair flowing. She is wearing a professional blazer over a floral dress. Below her, a group of five diverse cartoon characters are smiling. The background is a swirling, pastel gradient of pinks, blues, and yellows, evoking a sense of celebration and transition. Scattered around the leaping woman are playful, symbolic elements: a golf club, a seashell, and a running shoe, hinting at future activities. The text \"Congratulations Teresa!\" is prominently displayed in a friendly, rounded, yellow-orange font with a subtle outline, positioned in the central area of the card. In the lower left corner, a stylized computer monitor and desk represent a past work environment, contrasting with the vibrant, celebratory elements. A whimsical vine with colorful flowers is growing from the desk area, connecting the past to the present celebratory scene. The overall mood is overwhelmingly positive, energetic, and celebratory.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a dreamy fantasy anime style. The artwork features a minimalist and serene composition, presenting a single, stylized blue golf club on a gracefully curling stem, emerging from a soft blue table. The golf club is depicted with subtle highlights, and a small, glowing pearlescent orb hangs from a secondary stem. The background is a gradient of soft pastel pinks and blues, reminiscent of a hazy, ethereal sky, with a few subtle sparkling star-like elements near the golf club. The overall aesthetic is peaceful and subtly creative, providing a gentle conclusion to the card's visual story without text or people. The composition is centered, with ample negative space, and appears suitable for a full-bleed background. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dreamy fantasy anime style, featuring a vibrant and energetic explosion of pastel-colored fireworks against a deep blue, starry sky. Stylized silhouettes of palm trees are scattered throughout the scene, along with small, glowing stars. A silhouette of an airplane soars in the upper right, and several golf flags are subtly placed on small poles amidst the fireworks. The overall composition is full-bleed, with a soft, ethereal glow emanating from the central explosion, creating a magical and celebratory atmosphere. The colors are a harmonious blend of pink, yellow, blue, and purple, with a soft, slightly grainy texture that enhances the dreamy quality. The artistic technique is flat 2D illustration, with clean lines for the silhouettes and painterly strokes for the fireworks and background.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a warm, dreamy, and pastel color palette featuring soft sky-like gradients of pale blue, pink, and yellow. The background is filled with a gentle wash of these colors, evoking a sense of soft clouds and ethereal light. Along the left and right edges, elegant, flowing abstract watercolor-like brushstrokes in shades of lavender, teal, and peach create a decorative border that frames the central text area. These fluid lines are accented with subtle, scattered star-like sparkles, adding a touch of magic and wonder. The main printed text, \"Retirement congratulations! Have fun with beach travel golf exercise\", is presented in a graceful, flowing script font. \"Retirement congratulations!\" is in a muted purple, while the subsequent words \"beach\", \"travel\", \"golf\", and \"exercise\" are each in a different pastel hue that complements the overall palette, creating a playful and visually appealing list. Beside \"beach\" is a small, stylized illustration of a globe, symbolizing travel. Next to \"travel\" is a simple graphic of a golf ball on a tee. Beside \"golf\" is a light blue dumbbell, representing exercise. The text is positioned centrally, leaving ample space around it for a handwritten message, with the decorative elements artfully placed to enhance rather than overwhelm the message area. The overall style is dreamy, whimsical, and softly illuminated, capturing a playful yet serene mood."
