BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\nVISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:\n- Same color palette across all sections\n- Consistent lighting/time of day\n- Same artistic techniques and brushwork\n- Recurring visual motifs or symbols (but make them unique and memorable!)\n- Progressive emotional journey from introduction to resolution\n- Front cover: stylized cartoon/illustrated characters if people are needed for the theme\n- Left interior: CREATIVE FREEDOM but NO PEOPLE unless user specifically requested people in their description\n- Right interior: focus on message space with innovative decorative elements (NO PEOPLE)\n- Back cover: simple yet creative decorative design without text or people\n- Use simplified, friendly, charming character design if including people (front cover only)\n- CREATIVITY PRIORITY: Always choose the more innovative, surprising, and memorable option over generic designs\n\nReturn JSON:\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"detailed prompt with story opening elements\",\n  \"backCover\": \"detailed prompt with story conclusion elements\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Create a completely unique and different interpretation for this specific card variant. Use different creative approaches, color schemes, compositions, and artistic elements while maintaining the same core theme and requirements.",

    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card, watercolor style, 9:16 ratio. Features a split composition with two stylized cartoon characters. On the left, a character with dark hair pulled back, wearing glasses, a grey sweater, and dark pants, holds a paintbrush and looks distressed, with a single drop of grey paint falling from the brush. Their expression is a frown. On the right, a joyful character with dark hair, splattered with vibrant rainbow colors on their face, shirt, and pants, holds multiple paintbrushes with colorful bristles. This character is smiling broadly, with paint splatters around them. The background on the right is a dynamic, abstract watercolor wash of bright blues, greens, yellows, oranges, and reds. The background on the left is a muted, creamy beige with a subtle paper texture. The text \\\"Happy Birthday Geihs\\\" is written in a flowing, elegant brown handwritten cursive script, positioned centrally and safely away from the edges. The overall mood is humorous, depicting a contrast between artistic struggle and artistic triumph.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card, watercolor style, 9:16 ratio.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a minimalist, artistic conclusion. The design features soft, flowing watercolor brushstrokes in a gradient of teal, pink, yellow, and blue, seamlessly merging into a muted gray. These colorful strokes curve gracefully from the bottom left towards the top right, evoking a sense of ongoing artistic creation. The background is a subtle, textured off-white or pale cream, reminiscent of watercolor paper. The overall composition is clean and serene, with the majority of the space on the right and top left left open, providing a peaceful visual resolution. There is an intentionally clear, approximately 1-inch square area in the bottom-right corner, reserved for a QR code, ensuring no decorations interfere with this functional space.

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card, featuring a watercolor illustration of a paintbrush held by an unseen artist, with broad, flowing strokes of pastel colors curving upwards from the brush. The colors of the strokes, from left to right, are a soft teal, a muted pink, a warm yellow, and a dusty blue, all rendered with visible watercolor texture, soft edges, and subtle paint bleeds onto a textured, off-white background. The paintbrush itself is depicted in grayscale with a delicate, wooden handle and a softly fanned brush tip, appearing to be the source of the colorful artistic expression. The composition is dynamic, with the colorful arcs sweeping across the majority of the page, leaving ample white space on the right for a message. The overall aesthetic is light, artistic, and serene, with a gentle, creative energy. The style is flat 2D artwork with a full-bleed background.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, artistic watercolor splash design. The right half of the page features a joyful, cartoon-style character covered in colorful paint splatters, holding multiple paintbrushes with brightly colored bristles. This character is depicted mid-celebration, with a wide, happy smile and eyes closed in delight. The background behind this character is a chaotic yet harmonious explosion of watercolor paint in shades of blue, teal, yellow, orange, and red, with visible brushstrokes and paint bleeds that create a dynamic, energetic feel. The left half of the page is a pale, textured beige, creating a clear area for writing a personal message. This area is free of any main illustrations, with only subtle, light watercolor splatters and a few small paint drops that subtly echo the theme without encroaching on the writing space. The overall aesthetic is one of artistic transformation and joyful expression, utilizing a warm and inviting color palette. The style is a flat 2D watercolor illustration, with a slightly textured paper feel. The 9:16 ratio is maintained, with full-bleed backgrounds. The transition between the two halves of the interior page is marked by the edge of the pale beige area meeting the vibrant watercolor, with a soft, blended edge."
