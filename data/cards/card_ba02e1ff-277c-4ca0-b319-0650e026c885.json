    "frontCover": "A vibrant, flat 2D comic book style birthday card front cover. In the center, a cartoon superhero version of \"Sarah,\" based on the reference photo, strikes a dynamic, powerful pose, bursting forward with an energetic aura. She has a determined, joyful expression. In the background, a cartoon version of \"John,\" also based on the reference photo, is depicted in a comical, slightly clumsy sidekick pose, maybe tripping over a cape or juggling a stack of gift boxes precariously. The scene is filled with classic comic book elements: bold black outlines, vibrant primary colors, and a background of Ben-Day dots and action lines like \"BAM!\" and \"POW!\". A large, explosive speech bubble near Sarah's head exclaims \"It's my Super Birthday!\". In the center of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, and bold handwritten cursive script.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A simple, clean back cover design in a flat 2D comic book style. The background is a solid, vibrant yellow with a subtle pattern of red Ben-Day dots. In the center, a single, stylized comic book action word, like \"ZAP!\", is depicted in a dynamic, explosive graphic with bold black outlines and a blue and white fill. The overall design is minimal and clean. CRITICAL: The bottom-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square area, must be left completely blank and free of any design elements for QR code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed interior design in a vibrant, flat 2D comic book style, matching the front cover. The artwork features a dynamic, abstract pattern of overlapping comic book action graphics like \"BAM!\", \"POW!\", and \"WHAM!\" in various sizes and angles. The color palette consists of bold primary colors\u2014red, blue, and yellow\u2014with thick black outlines and a background of classic Ben-Day dots. The design is purely decorative, with no text or characters, creating an energetic and visually cohesive look with the rest of the card.",
    "rightInterior": "A full-bleed interior panel in a flat 2D comic book style. The background features a large, off-center, explosive comic book-style starburst in yellow and orange, against a blue background with a subtle Ben-Day dot pattern. Integrated within this vibrant artwork, the following message is written in a beautiful, readable, and bold handwritten cursive script with a black outline: \"Happy birthday, Sarah! They say you get wiser with age, but I'm just happy we're still young enough to remember where we left our keys. Here's to another year of questionable decisions and laughing way too much! Your partner in crime, John\". The text is the central focus, artfully arranged to be clear and legible amidst the decorative elements. No characters are depicted."
