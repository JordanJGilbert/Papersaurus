    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that brings the story to a peaceful close. In the center-left area, a beautiful, delicate watercolor illustration of the translucent gift ribbon from the front cover is shown, now untied and gracefully curled on the ground. A few tiny, shimmering watercolor sparkles float gently above it, echoing the magic of the 'gift'. The background is a serene, soft wash of the same color palette from the front cover. The style is minimalist and artistic, with soft colors and visible paper texture, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration. A charming cartoon-style character inspired by the provided reference image, representing Jordan, is comically straining to hold a giant, shimmering, translucent gift box tied with a simple ribbon. Inside the box, instead of a gift, a glowing, artistic watercolor rendering of his own smiling face is visible, as if he is the gift. He is winking playfully. The background is a soft wash of cheerful colors like yellow, peach, and light blue. In the center, beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script says \"Happy Birthday!\". The entire scene is painted in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds.",
    "leftInterior": "A whimsical and funny watercolor illustration depicting a gallery wall of overly grand, ornate, empty picture frames of various shapes and sizes. In the very center, one small, simple frame contains a tiny, charming watercolor painting of a cartoon-style Jordan character's smiling face, winking, tying into the front cover's 'gift'. The other frames are hilariously empty, implying that he is the only masterpiece needed. The background is a soft, warm watercolor wash, creating a humorous and artistic scene. The style is consistent, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design focusing on the humorous message. The background is a soft, elegant wash of peach and yellow watercolors. The text is framed by a whimsical, hand-painted border made of artistic, glowing watercolor sparkles that swirl and dance around the message, as if capturing the 'amazing' quality mentioned. The message is written in the center in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a super expensive gift, but then I remembered having me as your boyfriend is the greatest gift of all. You're welcome! I hope you have a day that's as amazing as you are. Love, Jordan\". The overall design is clean, artistic, and lighthearted, perfectly matching the card's humorous tone."
