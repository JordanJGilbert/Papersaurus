    "frontCover": "Greeting card front cover. A humorous and lighthearted beach birthday party scene, rendered in a beautiful flat 2D watercolor style with soft, blended colors and delicate ink outlines.\n\nThe scene features cartoon versions of Lao Lao (from the left of the photo) and Jordan (from the right of the photo). Lao Lao is in the foreground, laughing joyfully as she is being playfully chased down the sandy shoreline by three small, fluffy, and comically excited dogs. One of the dogs, a little scruffy terrier mix, has a tiny birthday party hat perched sideways on its head. Another dog, a fluffy poodle mix, is mid-air, leaping for a squeaky toy hotdog she holds just out of reach.\n\nIn the mid-ground, Jordan stands beside a ridiculously oversized, multi-tiered sandcastle decorated with seashells and seaweed \"confetti.\" He's holding a half-built birthday banner that humorously reads \"Happy Birth...\" with the \"day\" part drooping into the sand. He has a funny, slightly exasperated but loving expression as he watches the chaotic chase unfold.\n\nThe beach setting is idyllic, with gentle turquoise waves lapping at the shore. The sand is a warm golden color with watercolor splashes and speckles. A couple of stray beach toys, like a bright red pail and a blue shovel, are scattered in the foreground.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating in a clear area of the sky above the action, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script. The composition is dynamic and full of life, with a clean white border framing the artwork.",
    "backCover": "Minimalist back cover for a greeting card. A simple, elegant watercolor wash of soft turquoise and warm golden sand hues blending together, evoking a tranquil beach at sunrise. The background has a subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds at the edges. A single, small, beautifully detailed seashell, painted in the same delicate watercolor style with fine ink outlines, rests in the upper-left corner. The overall composition is clean and very sparse, leaving the bottom-right quadrant completely empty. Flat 2D artwork, in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior panel of a greeting card. A subtle and artistic beach scene with no people or animals. The bottom third of the panel features a gentle wash of warm golden sand with delicate watercolor splashes and speckles. A few scattered seashells and a single piece of smooth sea glass are artfully arranged along the sand line. The top two-thirds is a soft, light sky-blue watercolor wash. The overall feeling is calm and serene, creating a beautiful, non-distracting decorative panel. Flat 2D artwork, in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to hold a message. The background is a very pale, almost white, sandy watercolor wash with a visible paper texture. A minimalist decorative border frames the page, composed of a thin, delicate watercolor line in a soft turquoise color. In the top-left and bottom-right corners, there are small, elegant clusters of tiny seashells and starfish, painted with fine detail and soft colors, anchoring the design but leaving the central area open and clear for text. Flat 2D artwork, in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my dearest Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I love you more than little dogs love getting treats, which is saying a whole lot. You're even cuter than a basket full of puppies, and that's scientifically impossible. Here's to another year of you being the best thing ever!\n\nWith all my love,\nJordan\""
