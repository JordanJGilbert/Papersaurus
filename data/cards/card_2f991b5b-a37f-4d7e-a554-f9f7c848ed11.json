    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card front. The scene features a cartoon caricature of Lauren, based on the reference photo, gleefully riding on the back of a slightly bewildered but friendly cartoon T-Rex dinosaur. Lauren is wearing a party hat, laughing, and holding a single slice of birthday cake with a lit candle as if it's a trophy. The T-Rex is also wearing a comically oversized party hat that is slightly askew. They are in a lush, prehistoric-style field with oversized, colorful flowers. The watercolor style is soft and flowing, with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. In the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday\". Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor illustration for a birthday card back. The design features a single, oversized, colorful prehistoric flower, matching those from the front cover, painted in the upper-left corner. The background is a soft, muted wash of color from the same palette as the front, with a subtle paper texture and visible artistic brush strokes. The overall feel is peaceful and clean. IMPORTANT: The bottom-right corner, at least 1-inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated, with only the soft background texture. No text, no people, no characters. Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative watercolor illustration for the left interior of a birthday card. The artwork is a seamless, full-bleed pattern of the oversized, colorful prehistoric flowers from the front cover. The flowers are arranged in a beautiful, harmonious composition against a soft, textured watercolor background. The style is consistent with the front cover, featuring soft flowing colors, organic paint bleeds, and visible artistic brush strokes, creating a lush and celebratory feel. No text, no people, no characters. Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor illustration for the right interior of a birthday card. The design features a delicate frame of the same colorful, prehistoric-style flowers and lush foliage from the front cover, artfully arranged along the top and bottom borders. The central area is clear, showcasing a soft, textured watercolor wash for maximum readability. In this central space, the following message is written in a beautiful, elegant, and highly legible handwritten cursive script: \"Happy birthday, Lauren! I was going to make a joke about you getting older, but then I remembered I'm still older than you, so we'll just skip that part. Hope you have a day that\u2019s as awesome as you are!\\n\\nAll the best,\\nSam\". The text has high contrast with the background, and the handwriting is clear, fluid, and easy to read. The artwork is styled with soft colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, perfectly matching the front cover. The text and decorative elements are positioned at least 10% away from all edges. No people or characters. Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7"
