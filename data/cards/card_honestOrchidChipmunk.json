    "frontCover": "Greeting card front cover. Flat 2D botanical illustration of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, transformed into charming cartoon characters. They are standing in a lush, whimsical garden filled with oversized, fantastical plants. Lao Lao is depicted comically struggling to hold up an enormous, ridiculously heavy-looking potted plant, with a strained but laughing expression. Jordan stands beside her with a big, amused grin, playfully flexing one bicep as if offering useless help. The scene is framed by a beautiful archway of flowering vines like wisteria and trailing ivy. The background is a soft, solid pastel color. In the center, below the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite weirdo\" written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The style is lighthearted and humorous, with clean lines, soft textures, and a vibrant, natural color palette. --ar 4:5\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference. Create a high-quality final version that:\n- Maintains the exact same composition, character positions, and overall design\n- Enhances details, textures, and color vibrancy\n- Corrects any minor imperfections or artifacts\n- Adds professional polish while staying true to the draft\n- Think of this as the \"final art\" version of the provided sketch\n\nORIGINAL CONTEXT TO MAINTAIN:\n- To: Lao Lao\n- From: Jordan\n- Relationship: Lao Lao is Jordan's girlfriend\n\n",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. Flat 2D botanical illustration style. The background is a solid, soft pastel color that matches the front cover's aesthetic. In the top-center, there is a single, small, gracefully illustrated flowering wisteria vine sprig with delicate purple blossoms and green leaves. The style is clean, with soft textures and a vibrant, natural color palette. The bottom half of the card, especially the bottom-right corner, is left completely empty for branding and a QR code. The overall visual density is very light, around 20% decoration. Final image should be a high-quality, polished version of the provided draft, with enhanced detail, texture, and color vibrancy. --ar 4:5"
