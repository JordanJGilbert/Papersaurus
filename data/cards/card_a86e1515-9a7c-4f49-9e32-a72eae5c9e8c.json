    "backCover": "A minimalist and artistic watercolor design that brings peaceful closure. On the left and center, a few whimsical, colorful watercolor confetti shapes from the front cover appear to be gently floating down and settling, creating a sense of calm after the party. One or two delicate party streamers are depicted as if they have gently drifted to rest. The background is a very soft, pale pastel watercolor wash, echoing the main color palette. The overall feeling is serene and subtly celebratory. The bottom-right corner area is left completely clear and unadorned.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and endearing watercolor scene. In the center, a charming cartoon grandmother with stylish grey hair and glasses sits in a comfy armchair, looking slightly surprised. Peeking out from behind the armchair with a mischievous grin is a cute cartoon toddler, holding a single lit candle on a tiny cupcake as if it's a secret plan. The background is a soft wash of warm pastel watercolors, with whimsical, floating birthday confetti and streamers that look like they are part of a secret toddler-led party takeover. In the center of the image, written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday!\". The style is a soft, artistic watercolor with visible paper texture, soft color bleeds, and delicate brush strokes, creating a funny and heartwarming opening to the story.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An abstract watercolor interpretation of a \"Spotlight Schedule\". The page is designed to look like a playful, hand-drawn daily planner or calendar grid, painted in soft, blended watercolors. Most of the 'time slots' are filled with colorful watercolor swatches labeled with whimsical doodles representing grandmother activities: a teacup, a book, a gardening trowel. However, one large, vibrant, star-shaped watercolor burst dominates the center, playfully labeled in a child-like scrawl: \"Vivi's Grand Entrance & Spotlight Stealing Time!\". Surrounding this burst are tiny, sparkling watercolor dots, adding to the humorous and lighthearted feel. The design is purely illustrative and abstract, with no people, celebrating the theme in an unexpected way.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design focusing on the message. The background is a soft, warm watercolor wash. Two elegant, intertwined ribbons of watercolor paint, one in a sophisticated lavender and the other in a playful pink, swirl gracefully around the central area, forming a loose, artistic frame. Where the ribbons cross, they create soft, beautiful color blends. These ribbons symbolize the two lives and birthdays intertwined. Inside this decorative frame, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, elegant handwritten cursive script with a personal, warm touch: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are!\\n\\nLove,\\nJohn, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\""
