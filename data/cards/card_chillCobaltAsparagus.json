    "frontCover": "A vibrant and humorous 2D flat illustration for a greeting card front. In a dreamy fantasy San Diego beach scene, the cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are having a magical adventure. Lao Lao, wearing a simple light blue sweatshirt and black pants, joyfully rides on the back of a giant, smiling seal that is surfing a whimsical, pastel-colored wave made of swirling boba milk tea. The wave has oversized, chewy tapioca pearls bouncing within it. Jordan, wearing a plain tan hoodie and dark pants, stands on a surfboard right behind her, arms playfully outstretched for balance, with a comically determined expression. The beach in the background is fantastical, with sandcastles shaped like boba cups and palm trees growing giant, colorful striped straws instead of coconuts. The sky is a dreamy mix of soft sunset pinks and oranges, with fluffy clouds shaped like splashes of milk. In the center, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, white handwritten cursive script. The overall tone is magical, ethereal, funny, and full of lighthearted personality.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant 2D flat illustration for a greeting card back cover. The design features a very small, single, stylized boba milk tea cup in the top-center, rendered in a dreamy fantasy anime style. The cup is a soft pastel color, subtly glowing, with a few whimsical tapioca pearls visible inside. The background is a solid, soft pastel pink, matching the sunset hues from the front cover. The artwork is clean, simple, and occupies only about 20% of the space, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty for a QR code. The overall aesthetic is ethereal, professional, and cohesive with a magical beach theme.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and subtle 2D flat illustration for the left interior panel of a greeting card, in a dreamy fantasy anime style. The artwork depicts a tranquil, magical beach scene at sunset, serving as a continuation of the front cover's environment but without any characters. The entire panel is a full-bleed background showing the lower portion of a fantasy beach. Gentle, pastel-colored boba tea waves with a few large tapioca pearls softly lap against the sand. The sand itself has a magical shimmer. Two whimsical sandcastles, shaped like stylized boba cups, sit near the water's edge. The color palette is dominated by the soft sunset pinks and oranges from the front cover, creating a warm, enchanting, and serene atmosphere. This decorative scene covers about 40% of the panel, primarily along the bottom half, leaving the top half as open sky.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist and elegant 2D flat illustration for the right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to frame a written message. The background is a solid, soft off-white or very light cream color, providing ample clean space for text. The decoration is confined to the bottom-right corner, featuring a small, artistic arrangement of a single whimsical palm tree whose fronds are replaced by colorful, oversized striped drinking straws, alongside a single giant, smiling tapioca pearl nestled in the sand at its base. The style is a dreamy fantasy anime aesthetic, using the same soft pastel color palette as the rest of the card. The decoration is minimal, occupying about 20% of the total space, ensuring the focus remains on the area for the message.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my dearest Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I hope your day is as bright and adorable as your cute little face when you're about to get your way. I fall for it every single time, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
