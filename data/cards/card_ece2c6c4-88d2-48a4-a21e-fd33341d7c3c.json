    "backCover": "A minimalist and clever design continuing the humorous orchestra theme. In the center-left area, a single, elegant music stand is depicted in the same flat 2D style and gold color from the front cover. Resting on the stand isn't sheet music, but a cartoon drawing of a tube of ointment labeled with a simple, generic cross symbol. The background is a solid, serene teal color from the card's main palette. The design is simple, artistic, and provides a quiet, humorous final punchline. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lively cartoon illustration in a flat 2D style. A diverse and cheerful group of cartoon people, inspired by the reference, are depicted as a comically disastrous orchestra. They are all holding mismatched, non-musical household items like pots, pans, a squeaky rubber chicken, and a vacuum cleaner, attempting to play them like instruments. They have exaggerated expressions of effort and concentration, creating a sense of chaotic but joyful noise. In the center, in a large, elegant, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday!\". The background is a simple, warm-toned solid color that makes the characters pop. The overall art style is whimsical and clean, with bold outlines and a vibrant, coordinated color palette of teal, coral, and gold that will be used throughout the card. Full-bleed background.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent the people in these reference photos with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:\n- REPRESENT ALL PEOPLE: If multiple reference photos are provided, create cartoon versions of ALL people shown, bringing them together in the same scene\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles worn by each person in their reference photo\n- COMPLETE accessories: include ALL accessories visible on each person (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.)\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\ncreate a card that includes all the people\n\nThe cartoon style should be charming and artistic while preserving complete visual accuracy to the reference photo. Every person in the reference must be represented with their exact appearance, clothing, and accessories.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed abstract soundwave pattern, rendered in a beautiful, artistic style. The soundwaves are composed of the card's core color palette\u2014teal, coral, and gold\u2014and flow dynamically across the page. Interspersed within the waves are small, subtle cartoon icons representing creaks, groans, and pops, like tiny lightning bolts, starbursts, and comic-style \"CRACK!\" text bubbles. The overall effect is visually interesting and energetic, humorously visualizing the sounds of creaking joints without being explicit. It's a creative and modern design that connects the front cover's noise to the right side's message. No people or characters.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed page featuring the message framed by innovative decorative artwork. The text \"Happy birthday! I was going to get you one of those cards that makes a sound, but I figured you hear enough creaking and groaning from your own joints already. Hope you have a fantastic day!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The script has a warm, personal feel with a natural pen-ink flow. Framing the message are artistic, stylized illustrations of antique audio equipment\u2014a vintage microphone, an old gramophone horn, and an ear trumpet\u2014all rendered in a clean, flat, graphic style using the card's gold and teal color palette. These elements are arranged artfully around the text, creating a sophisticated and witty visual joke that complements the message. Full-bleed background in a soft coral color."
