    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a whimsical, retro-futuristic cartoon art style. The color palette is dominated by a deep navy blue background, with pops of pink, orange, yellow, and teal. The main subjects include a smiling, anthropomorphic brain wearing a party hat, enclosed within a teal flying saucer with yellow accents. To the left of the flying saucer, there's a planet resembling Saturn with a slice of cake on top. Above and to the right, a yellow gift box with an orange ribbon and striped scarf floats, and a single lit white candle is visible. Small light blue dots and stylized white four-pointed stars are scattered across the background, simulating a starry night sky or outer space. Wisps of purple and pink cosmic clouds add depth. The text, \"HAPPY ANNUAL LEVEL-UP DAY!\", is displayed prominently in the lower half of the card in a bold, sans-serif, slightly rounded font, in a creamy yellow color. The composition is balanced, with the main elements arranged to draw the eye towards the central brain character. The overall mood is cheerful, celebratory, and playful, with a touch of imaginative wonder.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a flat, minimalist illustrative style. The background is a deep, muted navy blue with a subtle paper-like texture. The composition features a lit candle enclosed within a clear glass bell jar, placed in the lower right quadrant of the card. A delicate, wispy trail of faint purple glittery particles rises from the candle flame, ascending towards the upper left. Floating above this trail, in the upper left quadrant, is a single, stylized teal feather, also with a flat design. There is ample negative space, suggesting it's designed to complement a more elaborate front design, and is suitable for adding text or a QR code in the empty areas. The overall aesthetic is serene, magical, and evocative, creating a sense of quiet wonder and subtle enchantment.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a cream-colored background, featuring a dynamic, abstract design. A thick, dark navy blue diagonal shape cuts across the left side, creating a sense of depth and framing the main artwork. This shape appears to be textured, with small dark specks embedded in it. Scattered across the cream background are various stylized illustrations in a simple, thin line art style with flat color fills. These illustrations include: a multi-colored striped scarf with fringed ends (orange, yellow, blue, dark blue), a sneaker with laces, a retro-style fan, a lightbulb with radiating lines, two teapots, a cubic object with vertical stripes, a stylized musical note or clef, and two planetary objects with rings. Interspersed between these illustrations are geometric shapes: teal triangles, dusty rose squares, and light purple circles. Small dark blue dots are also scattered randomly. The overall artistic style is playful and whimsical, reminiscent of 1980s or 1990s graphic design, with a slightly retro, pop-art feel. The color palette is harmonious, with the muted pastels contrasting with the vibrant teal, orange, and navy blue elements. The composition is a delightful, somewhat chaotic arrangement of objects, creating a busy yet balanced visual feast. There is no text visible on this interior page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a warm, off-white background. The page is framed by thick, rounded orange lines with a playful, hand-drawn aesthetic. The top border features decorative flourishes resembling curling vines, small dots, and a stylized shooting star with a yellow star at its tip. The left side has a charming, cartoonish illustration of a pink brain with a happy, slightly mischievous expression, peeking from behind the orange border. A plus sign is subtly placed near the brain. The right side of the border includes a stylized, mechanical-looking flower stem with circular joints and leaf elements, rendered in muted grey and green. Decorative elements in the corners include small stars and dots. The typography is bold, black, sans-serif, with \"JORDAN,\" prominently displayed at the top, followed by a whimsical message. The layout effectively balances the decorative elements and illustrations with ample empty space in the center for a handwritten message. The overall artistic style is friendly, slightly retro, and whimsical."
