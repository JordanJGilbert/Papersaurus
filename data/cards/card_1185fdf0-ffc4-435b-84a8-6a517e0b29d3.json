    "frontCover": "a whimsical watercolor birthday card featuring two cute, cartoonish otters inspired by the reference photo, holding hands and floating on their backs in calm, light blue water. One otter wears a tiny, lopsided party hat. Above them, in a beautiful, readable, and slightly playful handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday\". The overall style is lighthearted and humorous, with soft flowing watercolor textures, visible paper grain, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds along the edges of the characters and water. The background is a clean, minimalist off-white, allowing the otters and text to be the central focus. Flat 2D artwork.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor design for the back of a greeting card. The background is a clean off-white with visible paper grain texture. In the upper-left corner, there is a small, whimsical watercolor illustration of a single tiny, lopsided party hat, matching the one from the front cover, casting a soft shadow. The art style is lighthearted with soft flowing watercolor textures and organic paint bleeds. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated. The overall composition is simple, elegant, and visually cohesive with the front cover.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative watercolor illustration for the interior of a greeting card. The design features a gentle cascade of colorful, abstract watercolor splotches and confetti shapes floating down from the top edge. The colors are soft blues, teals, and light browns, matching the palette of the otters and water from the front cover. The artwork has a lighthearted and celebratory feel, with visible paper grain, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. The background is a clean, minimalist off-white. The design is full-bleed, extending to all edges, with the main elements kept at least 10% away from the top and bottom edges.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design for the interior of a greeting card. The phrase \"Happy birthday! I was going to make an age-related joke, but honestly, I'm just impressed you're still this awesome. May your cake be sweet and your presents be plentiful!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, and slightly playful handwritten cursive script. The text is gracefully integrated with a whimsical watercolor illustration of a delicious-looking birthday cake slice on a small plate, decorated with a single lit candle. The cake and surrounding decorative elements like tiny floating bubbles use the same soft blue and light brown color palette from the front cover. The style features soft flowing watercolor textures, visible paper grain, and artistic paint bleeds. The background is a clean off-white. Key elements like the text and cake are centered and positioned at least 0.5 inches from the left/right edges and 10% from the top/bottom edges."
