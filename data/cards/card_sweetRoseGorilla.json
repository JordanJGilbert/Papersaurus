The word \\\"congratulations\\\" is elegantly scripted in a flowing, handwritten white font, positioned centrally in the lower half of the sky. Below the text, a deep blue ocean scene unfolds, with stylized, slightly transparent silhouetted sea turtles and small fish swimming in the dark blue water, punctuated by tiny white speckles representing light or plankton. The overall mood is heartfelt and serene, with soft watercolor textures and organic paint bleeds.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card in a watercolor painting style, continuing the theme from the front. It features a minimalist, serene design with subtle hints of the ocean and night sky.

Above the water line, which is subtly suggested by a horizontal band of lighter blue, the sky transitions into soft washes of pink and lavender, mirroring the front cover's nebula. Faint, delicate white constellation lines are scattered across the sky, hinting at guidance and dreams. The color palette is cohesive with the front, using deep blues, purples, and subtle pinks, all rendered with characteristic watercolor textures, soft brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. The overall tone is magical and aspirational.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior page of a greeting card in a watercolor painting style, designed to hold the message.

The message \\\"Mele\\n\\nSing your true song\\n\\nTravel with your heart\\n\\nTrust your heart\\\" is written in a beautiful, clear, handwritten cursive script in white, positioned centrally and safely within the layout. The handwriting style is elegant, warm, and personal, with a natural flow and slight variation in line weight, akin to sophisticated yet approachable calligraphy.
