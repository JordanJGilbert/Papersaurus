    "frontCover": "A charming watercolor painting of a slightly frazled, but very happy, cartoon sloth wearing a festive party hat, attempting to blow out a single, stubbornly lit candle on a tiny cupcake it's holding. The sloth has a look of comical concentration. Floating around the sloth are soft, colorful watercolor splotches that look like confetti. Centered below the sloth, in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"happy belated-ish birthday\". The entire design is a flat 2D artwork with a visible paper texture, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds characteristic of a real watercolor painting.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene full-bleed watercolor background with a visible paper texture. Soft, colorful watercolor splotches, reminiscent of the confetti from the front cover, are delicately painted and drift down from the top-left corner towards the center, fading out gently. The colors are muted and harmonious with the front cover. The design is clean and simple, with plenty of negative space. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1x1 inch, is intentionally left blank and undecorated, maintaining the pure paper texture for QR code placement. The artwork is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed decorative watercolor artwork that continues the theme from the front cover. A beautiful, abstract cascade of soft, colorful watercolor splotches, like a gentle explosion of confetti, flows diagonally from the top left corner towards the bottom right. The colors perfectly match the festive palette of the front cover. The composition is dynamic yet light, creating a sense of celebration without any characters or text. The entire piece has a visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, maintaining the hand-painted feel.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor illustration serving as a backdrop for a handwritten message. The top left and bottom right corners are adorned with clusters of soft, colorful watercolor splotches, echoing the confetti from the front cover. These decorative elements frame the central area, leaving it open for the text. Centered in this space, written in a beautiful, elegant, and exceptionally clear handwritten cursive script is the message: \"John,\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered I have to see you every day and I value my safety. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\n\nAll the best,\nLauren\". The text is rendered in a dark, contrasting ink for maximum legibility against the light watercolor background. The entire design has a visible paper texture, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds."
