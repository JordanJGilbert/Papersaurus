    "backCover": "A minimal and serene watercolor design that concludes the visual narrative. In the center and extending towards the left, a single glowing, golden watercolor tile, identical to the ones from the 'path of success' on the front cover, rests on a soft background of pastel blues and lavenders. A few delicate, glowing orbs of light, echoing the front cover's motif, float gently above the tile. The design is quiet and symbolic, representing the foundational support Deanna provided. The art is rendered in the same soft watercolor style with visible paper texture and gentle paint bleeds. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated.",
    "frontCover": "A beautiful watercolor illustration capturing a heartfelt moment between a young adult Asian man (Laotong) and a middle-aged Asian woman (his aunt Deanna), both depicted as stylized, friendly cartoon characters. They are standing on a stylized, slightly abstract 'path of success' made of glowing, golden watercolor tiles that wind up a gentle hill. At the beginning of the path, the aunt has her hand on the young man's shoulder, looking at him with pride and encouragement as he takes a step forward. The background is a soft, dreamlike wash of pastel blues, lavenders, and warm pinks, suggesting a supportive and loving atmosphere. Floating around them are soft, glowing orbs of light, symbolizing her belief in him. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday, Deanna' is written in a beautiful, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script in a deep indigo color. The entire scene is rendered in a soft watercolor style with visible paper texture, soft bleeds, and delicate brushstrokes.",
    "leftInterior": "An abstract watercolor landscape that symbolizes a journey and growth. The page is filled with a soft, expansive wash of colors from the card's palette\u2014pastel blues, lavenders, and warm pinks blending seamlessly. A single, elegant, golden watercolor line gracefully meanders from the bottom left corner, sweeping upwards across the page towards the top right, representing the path of life and success. The line varies in thickness, created with artistic brushstrokes, as if drawn with a brush laden with golden ink. Along this path, subtle watercolor blooms of deep indigo and soft pink appear, suggesting moments of support and love that blossomed along the way. The overall feeling is expansive, hopeful, and deeply emotional, rendered in a beautiful watercolor style with soft edges and visible paper texture.",
    "rightInterior": "The heartfelt message is the central focus, beautifully framed by innovative watercolor artwork. The text is written in an elegant, legible, and warm handwritten cursive script in a deep indigo color. The message reads: 'Deanna,\\nOn your birthday, I hope you feel all the love you've so generously given me. I wouldn't be who I am, or where I am, without your belief in me and your constant support. Thank you for everything.\\n\\nWith all my love,\\nLaotong'. The message is encircled by a delicate, abstract wreath not of flowers, but of intertwined, glowing golden lines that echo the 'path' motif from the front cover and left interior. These lines gracefully loop and weave around the text, interspersed with soft, glowing orbs of light and subtle watercolor splashes of pink and lavender. The design feels like a warm, protective embrace of light and love around the heartfelt words. The background is a simple, soft cream with visible paper texture, allowing the text and the golden artwork to shine."
