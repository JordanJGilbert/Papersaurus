    "backCover": "A minimalist, artistic design on a clean white background. In the center, a single, beautifully illustrated croissant rests on a smooth, purple, amethyst-like rock. A tiny scoop of lavender ice cream is perched playfully on top of the croissant, just starting to melt a little. The style is clean and simple, with delicate lines and a soft color palette of purples and golds, echoing the front cover's theme in a subtle, serene way. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated, with the design focused towards the center and left.",
    "frontCover": "Minimalist Studio Ghibli style art of a joyful young woman and a little girl, their cheeks touching in a sweet embrace. The little girl is giving the woman a gentle kiss on the cheek. They are both smiling warmly, depicted with simplified, charming cartoon features. They are surrounded by a whimsical, sparse arrangement of floating purple amethyst-like rocks, golden-brown croissants, and scoops of lavender-colored ice cream. The background is a soft, pale lavender wash with plenty of clean white space. Centered in the middle of the composition, the text 'Happy Birthday' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, playful handwritten cursive script.

    "leftInterior": "A minimalist, playful abstract pattern fills the page. The design consists of a sparse, energetic sprinkle of small, hand-drawn elements against a clean white background. The elements include simple outlines of croissants, small, geometric purple rock shapes, and whimsical lavender-colored ice cream drips. The composition is dynamic and airy, with plenty of negative space, creating a fun, energetic, and sophisticated feel that complements the overall card design. The style is clean, with simple shapes and a cohesive purple and gold color palette.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist and elegant design focusing on the message. The text \"Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey! It's pretty clear that greatness decided to strike twice on the same day, and we're so glad we get to celebrate both of you. May your day be filled with double the cake, double the fun, and only half the shenanigans... maybe. Lots of Love, The Gilberts\" is written in a beautiful, legible, and warm handwritten cursive script. The message is framed by a delicate, artistic swirl of lavender-colored watercolor that starts at the top left and curves gracefully down towards the bottom right, resembling a playful ice cream swirl. Tiny, minimalist gold-leaf-style croissant and purple rock shapes are subtly embedded within the watercolor swirl, adding a touch of whimsy. The background is clean white, ensuring the heartfelt message is the central focus."
