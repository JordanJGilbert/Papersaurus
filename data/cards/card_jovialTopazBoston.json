Basically what Iâ€™m saying is, thx for being born. I love all of you,\nJ\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1.

BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the unique and unconventional tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card with a charming watercolor illustration. The scene depicts a lush, green forest background with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through the trees. In the center, a robust, turquoise-colored character with a muscular build is lifting a barbell made of logs. He is wearing simple brown shorts. To his left and right, on top of red and white spotted mushrooms, are two small, adorable, yellow, rabbit-like creatures with big ears, looking cheerful and energetic. Another green, bird-like creature with large eyes is perched on a branch of a tree on the upper left. The text \"Happy Birthday!\" is displayed in a playful, slightly whimsical teal font, positioned prominently in the upper-middle section of the card, safely within the printable area. The overall mood is joyful, whimsical, and slightly humorous, perfectly capturing the theme of a quirky and sweet birthday celebration with a focus on a love for nature and fitness. The art style is distinctly watercolor, with visible brush strokes, soft color blending, and a gentle paper texture. The color palette consists of various shades of green, turquoise, yellow, and pops of red from the mushrooms.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The background is a soft, abstract wash of muted greens and blues, suggesting a serene, natural environment, similar to a forest floor bathed in dappled light. In the foreground, there's a single, stylized dumbbell, appearing almost organic, as if it's made of moss or overgrown with greenery. Three vibrant, stylized feathers in yellow, coral, and blue lie scattered on the ground near the dumbbell. The overall impression is peaceful and subtly whimsical, complementing the artistic theme. There is no text or visible space reserved for a QR code, allowing for a clean, artistic resolution to the visual story. The composition is simple and focused, with the dumbbell as the central element. The colors are soft and blended, characteristic of watercolor, with visible brush strokes and a gentle paper texture.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a whimsical, hand-drawn map illustration in a soft watercolor style. The map depicts a winding, dotted brown path leading through stylized green hills and a blue river. Text labels such as \"THE GAINSBOROUGH TRAIL,\" \"THE BOULDER SHOULDERS MOUNTAINS,\" and \"THE SIX-PACK PLAINS\" are integrated into the scene in a bold, black, sans-serif font. To the left, a blue shaker bottle and a dark teal kettlebell are illustrated, representing workout equipment. The overall color palette consists of muted greens, blues, browns, and tans, with visible watercolor textures and organic paint bleeds. The composition is flat, 2D, and designed for a full-bleed background.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical, hand-drawn botanical border in soft watercolor. The border features intertwining green vines with delicate leaves and small, abstract orange and yellow flourishes. In the upper corners, a charming, stylized brown bird is perched on the left vine, and a cute, small brown rabbit is sitting on the right vine, both depicted in a flat 2D illustration style with subtle watercolor textures. The central area of the page is open and a pale, textured cream color, perfectly formatted to hold handwritten text. The overall color palette is soft and earthy, with gentle greens, yellows, oranges, and a light sky blue in the background that fades subtly towards the center. The artistic style is consistent with delicate watercolor brush strokes and a slightly textured paper feel, creating an organic and sweet, yet quirky, visual."
