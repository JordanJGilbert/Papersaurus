    "backCover": "Minimalist decorative design on a solid soft white background. A single, gracefully curved line in coral pink sweeps up from the bottom left, arcing towards the upper center, where it bursts into a small, delicate firework-like shape made of simple lines and dots in mint green and sunny yellow. The design is simple, elegant, and subtly energetic, providing a peaceful resolution to the card's theme. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty. The artwork uses clean lines and maintains the card's minimalist aesthetic and color palette.",
    "frontCover": "Minimalist flat 2D illustration of two little cartoon girls, representing twins, jumping joyfully in mid-air against a clean, solid soft white background. The girls, inspired by the reference of a 'little girl kissing woman\u2019s cheek', are styled with simplified, charming features. They have dynamic, energetic poses with arms outstretched as if celebrating. A shower of tiny, colorful confetti in pastel shades of mint green, sunny yellow, and coral pink falls around them. In the center of the image, the text \"Happy Birthday Twins!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, playful handwritten cursive script. The entire composition uses clean lines, simple shapes, and plenty of white space, embodying a fun, energetic, and minimalist style.

    "leftInterior": "Minimalist abstract artwork on a clean, solid soft white background. A dynamic composition of overlapping geometric shapes in pastel shades of mint green, sunny yellow, and coral pink. A large, playful semi-circle anchors the bottom left, while sharp triangles and soft-edged circles seem to float and dance across the page, creating a sense of movement and celebration. The design is energetic yet clean, using ample white space to maintain a sophisticated and minimalist feel, visually connecting to the confetti on the front cover.",
    "rightInterior": "Minimalist design on a clean, solid soft white background. The message is the central focus, beautifully written in an elegant, legible, and warm handwritten cursive script. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey! It's pretty clear that greatness decided to strike twice on the same day, and we're so glad we get to celebrate both of you. May your day be filled with double the cake, double the fun, and only half the shenanigans... maybe. Lots of Love, The Gilberts\". The message is framed by two subtle, intersecting calligraphic swooshes, one in mint green and one in coral pink, that sweep around the text block, adding a touch of artistic flair without cluttering the space. The design is elegant, personal, and uses plenty of white space."
