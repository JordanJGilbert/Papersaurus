    "frontCover": "Here are the detailed prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing congratulations greeting card, based on your original context and the provided image.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card, minimalist flat 2D artwork, full-bleed dark navy blue background. A delicate, thin golden line art depicts a profile silhouette of a woman with her eyes closed, appearing to be dreaming or in deep thought. Emanating from her head, a single golden line curves upwards and transforms into the iconic outline of a suspension bridge, symbolizing connection and a journey. Below the silhouette, the word \\\"congratulations\\\" is written in elegant, flowing golden cursive script, positioned centrally and safely away from the edges. At the bottom of the card, three thin, wavy golden lines suggest ocean waves, and beneath them, a small, silhouetted sea turtle is visible, referencing Hawaiian heritage and ocean themes. The overall mood is serene, heartfelt, and sophisticated, with clean lines and ample negative space.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card, minimalist flat 2D artwork, full-bleed dark navy blue background, continuing the elegant theme. A single, thin golden line art depicts the silhouette of a stylized, simplified sea turtle swimming gently in the ocean. This element subtly echoes the turtle from the front cover, providing a sense of closure and connection to the theme of travel and heritage. The design is extremely simple, focusing on the turtle and leaving the majority of the space open. The bottom-right corner (approximately 1 inch square) is completely clear for a QR code. The design is centered and slightly towards the left, maintaining a serene and peaceful atmosphere, with clean lines and a limited color palette consistent with the front cover.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card, minimalist flat 2D artwork, full-bleed dark navy blue background. This section visually represents navigating across the world and embracing dreams. A single, flowing golden line art depicts a stylized, minimalist star constellation or a celestial path, subtly suggesting navigation and journey. Intertwined with this celestial element are faint, abstract representations of flowing water or currents, hinting at the ocean and travel. The composition is clean and open, with a focus on the upward movement and progression of the golden lines. There are no people or characters depicted. The mood is contemplative and hopeful, using the same sophisticated color palette and line art style as the front cover, creating a sense of a journey unfolding.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card, minimalist flat 2D artwork, full-bleed dark navy blue background. This section visually culminates the narrative with a heartfelt message. The handwritten message, \\\"Mele\\n\\nSing your true song\\n\\nTravel with your heart\\n\\nTrust your heart\\\", is rendered in a beautiful, clear, and flowing golden cursive script, positioned centrally and safely away from the edges. The handwriting has a natural, warm, and personal feel, with slight variations in line weight to suggest a pen. The message is elegantly framed by subtle, abstract golden line art that evokes flowing water, gentle waves, or perhaps the unfurling of dreams. These decorative elements are sophisticated and unique, avoiding clich√©s and harmonizing with the overall minimalist aesthetic. The mood is deeply sincere, emotional, and encouraging, creating the emotional peak of the card experience.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a congratulations card with a minimalist, flat 2D art style. The background is a deep, dark navy blue, evoking a night sky or deep ocean. Scattered across the upper portion of the card are several small, delicate golden dots, representing stars. Flowing across the center of the card is a stylized, abstract representation of a wave rendered in thin, elegant golden lines. The wave crests in the upper right quadrant, and within its curve, a simple, iconic golden torch with a flame is positioned. The torch is a minimalist outline, with the flame depicted as a stylized, flickering shape. The golden lines of the wave continue to flow and undulate across the rest of the background, creating a sense of movement and continuity with the theme. The composition is clean, with ample negative space, and focuses the visual interest on the single, symbolic image of the torch within the wave. There is no text on this back cover, and the design is strategically placed to allow for a QR code to be placed in the bottom right corner without obstruction, maintaining a clean and sophisticated aesthetic.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card, minimalist style with clean lines and simple shapes. The background is a deep, textured navy blue, reminiscent of a starry night sky. Scattered across the canvas are small, subtle white dots representing distant stars. Dominating the scene are three constellations rendered in thin, elegant gold lines with glowing star points. The topmost constellation depicts a stylized sea turtle, its outline formed by interconnected golden lines and a few brighter stars marking key points. A single golden line with a star connects the turtle to the upper left edge. Below and slightly to the right of the turtle, a second constellation forms a delicate heart shape, also outlined in gold with a prominent star at its apex and another star to its left, connected by a golden line. Further down and to the right, the third constellation creates the simple, clean outline of an apple with a stem and a leaf, again defined by thin gold lines and a few sparkling star points, with a connecting golden line extending to the lower right. The overall impression is serene, magical, and sophisticated, evoking a sense of dreams and cosmic connection. The composition is balanced with ample negative space.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with elegant, minimalist line art on a deep navy blue background. The primary decorative element is a single, delicate golden line art drawing of a hibiscus flower positioned in the upper right quadrant, its stem curving gracefully down and to the left, framing the text. The message, \"Mele Sing your true song Travel with your heart Trust your heart,\" is rendered in a flowing, handwritten cursive script in the same golden hue. The text is centered and clearly legible, with ample white space around it. Small, subtle golden dots and starbursts are scattered sparingly throughout the background, adding a touch of celestial magic without overwhelming the design. The overall aesthetic is sophisticated, heartfelt, and serene."
