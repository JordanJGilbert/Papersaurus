    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a retro vintage, humorous, and lighthearted tone, in a 9:16 ratio. The artwork is flat 2D with a full-bleed background. The scene depicts a charming, stylized apothecary or chemist's shop setup, rendered in a 1950s-60s aesthetic. The color palette is warm and nostalgic, featuring dominant shades of golden yellow for the floor and background, with accents of muted orange for the walls and wood cabinetry.\n\nThe focal point is a wooden shelf against an orange wall, displaying three clear glass jars with light teal lids. Each jar contains a different assortment of colorful, candy-like pills or capsules. The first jar, labeled \"GIGGLE FITS\" on a cream-colored rectangular label, is filled with orange and red oval pills. The second jar, labeled \"EUPHORIA ELIXIR\" on a similar label, contains green capsules and some small green spheres. The third jar, labeled \"INSTANT CHARISMA\" on its label, is filled with yellow and orange elongated capsules.\n\nBelow this shelf, another wooden shelf is visible, holding two more glass jars with light teal lids and a green glass bottle. The first jar on this lower shelf, labeled \"HAPPY PILLS\" on a cream label, contains yellow and white pills. The second jar, labeled \"BLISS TABLETS\" on a cream label, is filled with orange pills. To the right of these jars sits a tall, slender green glass bottle with a light teal cap and a simple, stylized green leaf emblem on a light green square within a darker green rectangle.\n\nIn the foreground, on a yellow tiled floor with faint grid lines, rests a light cream-colored mortar and pestle. The mortar is filled with a chaotic, vibrant mix of small, multicolored pills and capsules, mirroring the contents of the jars. A small, detached part of the mortar, acting as a scoop, has spilled a portion of these colorful pills onto the floor. Scattered across the yellow tiled floor are subtle, charming decorative elements: several light green, solid hearts and stylized green musical notes, evoking the theme of music and love. The overall composition is clean, with bold shapes and flat colors, creating a playful and whimsical visual narrative consistent with a retro vintage style.",

The background is a soft, creamy off-white with subtle textured paper effect. A thin, golden-yellow border frames the entire design, with subtle, stylized floral corner embellishments in a muted orange and green. The overall aesthetic is warm, playful, and distinctly mid-century inspired."
