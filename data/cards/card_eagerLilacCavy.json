    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a dark navy blue, textured background. At the top, in elegant, flowing, off-white cursive script, is the text \"Thank you for helping prosper thought.\" Below the text, a central, large, intricately designed gear is depicted in shades of silver and gold. This central gear has a floral-like pattern within it, also in gold and silver. Branching out from the top and sides of this central gear are numerous smaller gears, varying in size and color (gold and silver), connected by delicate, thin lines that resemble stylized branches or circuitry. The overall aesthetic is sophisticated and slightly industrial-artistic, with a feeling of intricate connectivity and progress. At the bottom center of the card, there is a decorative, metallic-effect plaque or banner with a light grey border and a subtle yellow-gold fill, containing the name \"JOHN GILBERT\" in a clear, sans-serif font, also in off-white or light grey. The entire image has a subtle, almost painterly texture.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a deep, textured navy blue background. In the upper-left quadrant, a single, stylized, bright orange cogwheel is centered, emitting a soft, warm glow. A delicate, wispy white line, resembling chalk or a light brushstroke, curves gracefully from the top edge of the card down towards the cogwheel, appearing to have just connected or originated from it. The overall style is minimalist and symbolic, conveying a sense of focused energy or a singular idea. The composition is clean and uncluttered, leaving ample negative space. There is no text or QR code visible on this back cover. The artistic style suggests a subtle texture, similar to fine paper or a soft pastel drawing, creating a sophisticated and understated finish that brings a quiet, conceptual closure to the card's visual narrative.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dark navy blue background, featuring a complex, interconnected network of gears and pipes in a steampunk-inspired, industrial aesthetic. The gears are primarily in shades of brass and a darker, muted blue-grey, with intricate teeth and spokes. They are arranged in an overlapping, layered pattern, creating a sense of depth. Flowing through and around the gears are stylized pipes, rendered in a warm, glowing amber-orange color, emitting a soft light that illuminates the surrounding metallic surfaces. These pipes form a dynamic, winding pathway across the page. Centered within this mechanical landscape, the quote \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it.\" is displayed in a flowing, elegant, golden-yellow cursive font, reminiscent of a quill pen on parchment. The text is positioned to avoid the top and bottom 10% edges. The overall style is a flat 2D illustration with subtle texturing and a focus on detailed linework, evoking a sense of innovation, progress, and sophisticated craftsmanship. The composition is balanced, with the mechanical elements framing the central quote.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a framed, ornate border. The border is composed of intricate, interlocking gears and swirling filigree in muted blues and antique gold. The gears are depicted in a flat, 2D illustration style with subtle shading to give them a sense of depth. The filigree elements are rendered with delicate, hand-drawn ink lines that mimic the texture of antique engravings. The background within the frame is a soft, textured pale blue watercolor wash. The text, \"Thank you for being a vital part of the conversation. Your presence and unique perspective helped plant the seeds for a brighter, more thoughtful future. Continue to let your curiosity lead the way and inspire positive change wherever you go.\", is presented in a beautiful, flowing cursive script in a dark, rich ink.
