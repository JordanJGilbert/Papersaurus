    "frontCover": "A flat 2D comic book style birthday card front cover for John from Lauren. A charming, cartoon-style superhero, slightly paunchy with a silly grin and wearing a bright red cape, is depicted in a dynamic, mid-air pose as if just landing with a thud. He's surrounded by a classic comic book \"KAPOW!\" starburst effect. In a speech bubble above him, it humorously says, \"Don't worry, John! I've arrived to save you from another year of your youth!\" The background is a vibrant cityscape with halftone patterns. Centered in the middle of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The entire image has bold black outlines and a vibrant, energetic color palette typical of a vintage superhero comic.",
    "backCover": "A simple, minimalist design for the back of a greeting card, in a flat 2D comic book style. The background is a solid, vibrant yellow, overlaid with a subtle halftone dot pattern, consistent with the front cover. In the top-center, a single, stylized comic book sound effect, like \"ZING!\" or \"POW!\", is rendered in bold, energetic lettering with a red and blue color scheme and a thick black outline. The rest of the design is clean and uncluttered. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and free of any design elements, patterns, or colors, providing a clear space for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed interior panel for a greeting card, rendered in a vibrant, flat 2D comic book art style. The design features a dynamic, abstract composition of overlapping comic book action elements. Bold, jagged starburst shapes, reminiscent of \"KAPOW!\" effects from the front cover, explode from the corners in bright reds, yellows, and blues. Wavy speed lines and a subtle halftone dot pattern fill the background, creating a sense of energy and motion. The entire image has bold black outlines and uses the same energetic color palette as the front cover, but contains no characters, faces, or text.",
    "rightInterior": "A full-bleed interior panel for a greeting card, continuing the vibrant, flat 2D comic book art style. The background features a subtle blue halftone pattern. Decorative elements, such as a large, celebratory cake with candles and a few wrapped gift boxes, are drawn in the same bold-outlined, energetic comic style and placed along the bottom border, staying clear of the central text area. In the center of the panel, perfectly legible against the background, is the message written in a beautiful, clear, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The text reads exactly: \"John,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered I have to see you every day and I value my safety. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\n\nAll the best,\nLauren\". The text is rendered in a dark, high-contrast ink to ensure maximum readability, and is carefully positioned away from all edges, especially the top and bottom 10%."
