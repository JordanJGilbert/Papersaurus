TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a vibrant, celebratory watercolor and ink illustration style. The scene depicts a stylized, joyful rendering of Abhiram based on the reference photo, tossing his graduation cap in the air against a soft-focus, impressionistic backdrop of Virginia Tech's iconic limestone buildings. The colors are warm and optimistic, using Virginia Tech's maroon and orange as accent hues within a broader palette of sunny yellows, gentle sky blues, and celebratory gold flecks. The lines are loose and expressive, created with a fine ink pen, giving the artwork a personal, hand-drawn feel. The watercolor is applied with a wet-on-wet technique, allowing the colors to blend softly and bloom organically, evoking a sense of happy memories and a bright future. The overall effect is heartfelt, full of life, and radiates the pure joy and pride of the occasion.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY!

    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D illustration in a \\\"Smart Style\\\" with GenZ humor and chaotic energy. The background is a vibrant, swirling pattern of deep magenta, hot pink, electric blue, and warm orange lines, creating a sense of energetic movement. Prominently displayed at the top in bold, white, sans-serif block letters with a purple outline is the text \\\"HAPPY GRADUATION\\\". Below this, in large, cream-colored, sans-serif block letters with a dark purple outline, is the name \\\"ABHIRAM!\\\". Beneath the name, in smaller, yellow, sans-serif text, is \\\"WHAT A STREAK\\\". In the upper middle, a purple progress bar displays \\\"Graduation.exe 100%\\\" with a green fill, and to its right, a stylized golden trophy. The main focus is a charming, cartoon-style character in a graduation gown and cap, with dark hair, smiling widely and giving a peace sign with their right hand. The character appears to be in motion, with a black graduation cape flowing dramatically. Streaks of light in orange and blue emanate from the bottom left, with a stylized, angular digital pattern in white and blue. In the bottom right, a smaller, smiling cartoon face with dark hair is visible. The overall mood is celebratory, energetic, and playfully chaotic, with a vibrant, high-contrast color palette.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card featuring a minimalist, serene continuation of the \\\"Smart Style\\\" with GenZ humor and chaotic energy, rendered in flat 2D illustration. The background is a soft, gradient wash of deep magenta and warm orange, with subtle, wavy lines in lighter shades of pink and blue. In the upper left quadrant, a small, stylized golden trophy, mirroring the one on the front cover, is subtly placed. To the left of the trophy, a small, glowing orange circle with stylized flame-like extensions subtly hints at the fiery theme from the front. A few wisps of the blue and pink lines from the front cover might be present, but very subdued. The bottom right corner (approximately 1 inch square) is completely clear and undecorated, reserved for a QR code. The overall design is understated and peaceful, providing a gentle conclusion to the visual story while maintaining the color palette and artistic essence of the front cover.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior spread of a greeting card in a \\\"Smart Style\\\" with GenZ humor and chaotic energy, rendered in flat 2D illustration. This panel amplifies the energetic and chaotic themes. The background is a dynamic explosion of vibrant colors ‚Äì deep magenta, hot pink, electric blue, and bright orange, all swirling and overlapping with energetic, abstract lines and shapes. Elements from the front cover are reinterpreted: the \\\"Graduation.exe 100%\\\" progress bar might be larger or broken into pixelated fragments, suggesting a humorous glitch. The golden trophy could be depicted falling or spinning erratically. The stylized flame motif from the front cover might be larger and more active, perhaps fanning out across the page. Instead of a single character, multiple smaller, stylized cartoon faces, similar to the one on the front cover, are scattered throughout, some with exaggerated expressions of excitement or surprise, perhaps with speech bubbles containing playful internet slang or meme references. Geometric shapes and digital glitch effects (like pixelation or digital noise) are integrated into the design. The color palette remains high-contrast and saturated. The overall impression is one of controlled chaos and playful, unhinged energy, visually representing the 'main character energy' and 'celebration era'.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior spread of a greeting card, continuing the \\\"Smart Style\\\" with GenZ humor and chaotic energy, rendered in flat 2D illustration. This panel is dominated by the message, presented in a beautiful, legible, flowing cursive handwriting with a natural, warm ink-pen style. The text reads: \\\"Abhi, you absolutely understood the assignment. This whole graduation and VT thing? It's giving main character energy, no cap. We literally have no choice but to stan. Now go enter your celebration era, you've earned it. Slay, Neelu\\\". The handwriting is a creamy off-white color, with subtle variations in line weight to give it a handmade feel. This text is artfully integrated into a visually dynamic and unexpected decorative element. Instead of traditional borders, imagine abstract, digital-inspired graphics that echo the energy of the front cover. This could include scattered, stylized pixelated bursts in vibrant pink and blue, or abstract streaks of orange and yellow that weave around the text like a celebratory, digital aurora. The background is a continuation of the swirling, high-energy color palette from the front cover, but perhaps slightly softer or more diffused to allow the message to stand out. No people are present; the focus is on the typography and the artistic framing of the message, creating an emotional peak that harmonizes with the left interior spread while feeling uniquely designed.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a graduation greeting card, featuring a minimalist and serene aesthetic that provides a peaceful closure to the visual story. The background is a deep, muted maroon, consistent with the overall card's color palette. In the upper center, the phrase \"...and breathe\" is elegantly written in a soft, creamy white, flowing cursive script with a subtle, handwritten feel. Below this text, a white mug is depicted, held by a stylized, flat illustration of a hand in a warm, peachy-orange tone. The mug features a simple, graphic orange silhouette of a stylized bird, reminiscent of a small chicken or quail, in profile. Wisps of pale grey smoke gently curl upwards from the mug, adding a touch of warmth and implying a comforting beverage. The design is clean and uncluttered, with the focus on the text and the comforting imagery of the mug. There is no space explicitly reserved for a QR code, and the entire design is intended to be subtle and quietly memorable. The overall style is flat 2D illustration with a slightly textured grain, evoking a sense of calm and reflection.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dark navy background, featuring a chaotic yet vibrant comic-book-inspired explosion in a bright orange and dark red gradient at the center. Surrounding the explosion are stylized lightning bolts in yellow and light blue, scattered binary code (0s and 1s) in blue, red, and yellow, and small, abstract red and blue pixelated shapes. In the top left corner, a \"POW!\" graphic in bold yellow and pink text on a red starburst. To the left of the explosion, a simplified illustration of a closed book with a blue cover and white pages, outlined in purple. In the top right, a white rocket with a blue circle and fins, emitting orange flames from its base, soaring upwards. Towards the bottom right, an upward-trending graph line in yellow, with a jagged edge, leading to an orange arrow, and the text \"stonk\" in a bold, sans-serif white font. Below that, another upward-trending graph line in yellow and light blue, with a pink arrow. The overall aesthetic is a dynamic, high-energy visual representation of achievement and forward momentum, evoking a GenZ, internet-meme-influenced style with its bold graphics and energetic composition. The style is flat 2D artwork suitable for printing, with a full-bleed background.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a graduation greeting card designed for message space with a subtle yet celebratory decorative element.

Slay, Neelu\", presented in a legible, flowing, and warm cursive script with a natural ink-like appearance and slight variations in line weight. Framing the upper right portion of the card is an artistic flourish of stylized floral elements and branches in warm orange and brown hues, reminiscent of a simplified, slightly abstract floral pattern with a geometric, almost pixelated quality to the flowers. The background is a soft, creamy off-white, allowing the text and decoration to stand out. To the lower left of the message, there is a charming, stylized illustration of a stack of books topped with a maroon graduation cap, rendered in a flat, graphic style with bold outlines and a limited color palette of orange and maroon, conveying a sense of academic achievement. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and celebratory, with the decorative elements providing visual interest without overwhelming the message space. The art style is consistent with a flat 2D illustration, suitable for printing."
