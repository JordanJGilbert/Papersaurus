    "backCover": "A simple and artistic watercolor design bringing the story to a peaceful close. Two empty teacups, one a classic floral pattern and the other modern with polka dots, sit side-by-side in the center-left area. A single, long, colorful birthday scarf is loosely and artfully draped around the base of the cups, its ends trailing off the left edge. A few stray confetti pieces are scattered near the cups. The background is a very light, almost white, watercolor wash with subtle hints of yellow and pink from the front cover. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated. The style is minimalist watercolor, with soft colors, delicate brush strokes, and visible paper texture, providing a serene and complementary ending.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and whimsical watercolor scene. In the center, a charming cartoon grandma with stylish glasses and silver hair and a cute cartoon young granddaughter with pigtails stand side-by-side, sharing a ridiculously long birthday scarf that stretches between them. The scarf is brightly colored with festive patterns. Both characters are laughing heartily, looking at each other. Floating above them in elegant, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script is the text 'Happy Birthday Twins!'. The background is a soft, light watercolor wash of pastel yellows and pinks, suggesting a celebratory atmosphere. The entire image is in a flat 2D watercolor style with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. Key elements and text are positioned safely away from the edges.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "A highly creative and humorous watercolor illustration depicting two distinct birthday cakes sitting on a table. One cake is a classic, elegant tiered cake with delicate sugar flowers. The other cake is a chaotic explosion of sprinkles, candy, and gummy worms, with a single crooked candle. From the side of each cake, a cartoon party blower is unfurling, the two blowers meeting and tangling together humorously in the center of the image. The scene is playful and abstract, focusing on the contrasting and intertwined celebration elements. The background is a soft, celebratory watercolor wash consistent with the card's palette. This is a purely illustrative scene with no characters or text, embodying the 'double the fun' and 'shenanigans' theme with innovative visual humor. The style is flat 2D watercolor with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture.",
    "rightInterior": "The handwritten message is the centerpiece, rendered in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant cursive script with a personal, warm feel. The text is framed by an innovative and decorative watercolor design: an artistic representation of sound waves emanating from the top left and bottom right corners, rendered in soft celebratory colors like pastel pink, yellow, and blue. These abstract waves of color represent laughter and joy, visually echoing the 'double the fun' theme. Where the waves meet around the text, they transform into a cascade of tiny, colorful musical notes and whimsical confetti, creating a dynamic and joyous frame for the message. The message reads: \"Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey! It's pretty clear that greatness decided to strike twice on the same day, and we're so glad we get to celebrate both of you. May your day be filled with double the cake, double the fun, and only half the shenanigans... maybe. Lots of love, The Gilberts\". The design is purely decorative, with no characters, and is rendered in a soft watercolor style with visible paper texture."
