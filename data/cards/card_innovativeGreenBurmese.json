The edges of the leaves and trunk are slightly blurred, creating a dreamy, heartfelt quality. Sunlight filters through the canopy, dappling the ground below with soft, golden light, evoking a sense of warmth, optimism, and inspiration. The text \"John Gilbert\" and \"AI For Good June 2025\" is elegantly integrated in a deep sepia, hand-lettered font that feels both personal and professional.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a clean, minimalist, and slightly abstract design. The artwork features a stylized tree with branches resembling circuitry or a network, rendered in thin, elegant golden lines. At the ends of these branches are glowing orbs, alternating between a soft cyan blue and a warm yellow. The tree has a dark grey, almost black, trunk that tapers to a point at the base, with a subtle shadow beneath it. The background is a pale, textured cream or off-white, giving a sophisticated and refined feel. Below the tree, the text \"John Gilbert\" is displayed prominently in a dark grey, sans-serif font. Beneath this, in a slightly smaller but still clear font, are the words \"AI For Good\" and then \"June 2025\". The overall mood is modern, inspirational, and professional, with a focus on growth, connectivity, and technological advancement. The style can be described as modern digital art with subtle glowing effects and a clean, flat aesthetic.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist, abstract style. The background is a textured, creamy off-white, evoking a sense of subtle elegance. The composition features a single, delicate, golden-yellow stem, gracefully curving from the bottom left upwards and to the right, mimicking the artistic style and color palette of the front and interior panels. At the apex of the stem, a small, luminous, snowflake-like structure is depicted, glowing with a soft, bright cyan light. This abstract motif subtly references the concept of 'thought' and 'AI for Good' from the front cover, offering a quiet, elegant closure. The design is intentionally sparse, leaving the majority of the space open and uncluttered, with the bottom right corner entirely clear, reserved for a QR code. The overall impression is one of serene sophistication and understated beauty, providing a peaceful conclusion to the card's visual narrative.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a soft, pale cream background. A delicate, abstract illustration of a branching structure extends from the left edge towards the center. These branches are rendered in thin, subtle lines of muted gold and light brown. Scattered along these branches are small, glowing orbs in soft blues and warm yellows, some appearing to gently illuminate others. The overall aesthetic is minimalist, ethereal, and serene, evoking a sense of intellectual growth and inspiration. Positioned to the right of the branching illustration, in the central area of the page and safely away from the edges, is a quote in a refined, dark gray serif font. The quote reads: \"The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\" Below the quote, also in the same serif font, is the attribution: \"Ralph Waldo Emerson\". The visual style is clean and modern with a subtle, organic feel, harmonizing with an impressionistic watercolor style that suggests gentle blending and soft light.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with elegant, flowing cursive handwriting.

We are so grateful for minds like yours that are actively shaping a brighter, more thoughtful future for everyone. With sincere appreciation, The Vibecarding.com Team,\" is rendered in a dark, warm grey, mimicking natural ink with subtle variations in line weight and a graceful, approachable calligraphy style.
