    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a dreamy fantasy anime style. The scene depicts two stylized characters, a boy and a girl, sitting on a large, glowing crescent moon against a deep purple, starry night sky. The art style is reminiscent of soft watercolor or digital painting, with a magical and serene atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by shades of deep purple, lavender, soft blues, and the warm yellow of the moon, all illuminated by subtle starlight and subtle glows.\n\nThe boy, on the left, has dark blue hair and is wearing a dark blue hooded robe. He is holding a fishing rod with a glowing, star-shaped lure hanging from it, seemingly \"fishing\" for stars. His eyes are closed, conveying a sense of peace and contemplation. The girl, on the right, has light brown hair and is wearing a flowing lavender dress with puffed sleeves. She is sitting with her legs crossed and is holding a shimmering, star-patterned scarf that drapes over her lap and the moon. Her eyes are also closed, and a gentle smile graces her lips, suggesting happiness and contentment.\n\nThe background features a soft, textured sky with swirling lavender and purple clouds, dotted with numerous small, twinkling stars. The moon itself is large and luminous, casting a gentle glow on the characters.\n\nThe text \"Happy Anniversary\" is prominently displayed in the lower center of the image in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The letters are white with a subtle yellow outline, matching the ethereal and romantic tone of the illustration. The text is positioned to avoid the top/bottom 10% and left/right 0.5\" safe printing margins.\n\nThe overall mood is heartfelt, romantic, and whimsical, perfectly capturing the theme of a special anniversary and a \"thinking of you\" sentiment. The composition is balanced, drawing the viewer's eye to the central figures and the tender message.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a dreamy fantasy anime style, featuring a deep indigo night sky filled with a multitude of twinkling stars. A flowing, deep blue celestial fabric drapes across the upper portion of the frame, adorned with delicate, thin white lines forming constellations. The fabric has soft folds and a slightly textured appearance, catching the light subtly. The overall mood is serene and magical, with a subtle gradient in the sky from a slightly lighter shade at the bottom to a deeper hue at the top. There are no people or text elements. The bottom-right corner of the image is intentionally left clear to allow space for a QR code. The artistic style is characterized by soft, painterly textures and a dreamlike atmosphere, using a consistent color palette of deep blues and sparkling whites.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dreamy fantasy anime style. The scene depicts a deep indigo and sapphire blue starry sky, reminiscent of a cosmic ocean. Several translucent, glowing jellyfish drift gracefully through the expanse, their delicate tentacles trailing like ethereal ribbons. One large jellyfish floats prominently towards the upper right, its bell emitting a soft, warm light. Smaller jellyfish are scattered throughout the image. Interspersed with the jellyfish are constellations formed from delicate, shimmering star clusters, including some star shapes resembling asterisks. A large, flowing ribbon of deep purple, also dusted with twinkling stars, weaves across the lower half of the image, its ends trailing into wisps. The overall atmosphere is magical, serene, and deeply emotional, with a focus on soft, glowing light and shimmering textures. The art style is flat 2D, with a painterly quality, emphasizing a magical, ethereal, and heartfelt tone suitable for an anniversary card.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a dreamy fantasy anime style, featuring a celestial theme and heartfelt tone. The central area is dominated by a luminous, ethereal circular frame resembling an astrolabe, crafted from delicate, intricate light blue lines and subtle gradients. This frame encloses silhouetted vignettes of a couple in various romantic moments. The text \"An astrolabe of memories, to hold our treasured moments. With love,\" is elegantly displayed in a flowing, legible, handwritten cursive script, seemingly integrated into the luminous center of the astrolabe. The script's color is a soft, warm white or very light cream, with a pen-like appearance that suggests natural ink flow. The background is a deep, starry night sky, rendered in gradients of deep indigo and soft violet, with scattered tiny, shimmering stars and faint nebulae, creating a magical and expansive atmosphere. The overall composition emphasizes the central message and the symbolic astrolabe, with the silhouetted moments serving as visual embellishments within the celestial framework. The artwork uses soft pastels and a magical, enchanting fairy-tale quality, with consistent lighting that feels gentle and luminous. The design avoids any explicit characters or bold graphic elements, focusing on the abstract beauty of the celestial theme and the emotional weight of the message. The text is positioned safely within the image, respecting the 10% safe area from the top and bottom edges. The overall effect is one of profound sincerity and cherished memories within a vast, magical universe."
