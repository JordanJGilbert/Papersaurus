    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor painting for a greeting card back. The design features a simple, stylized silhouette of a roller coaster track arcing gracefully across the top of the frame. Below the track, a few soft, colorful bursts of red, white, and blue fireworks gently fade into the background. The entire image is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with a subtle paper texture, matching the front cover. There are no people. IMPORTANT: The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated.",
    "frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a funny Fourth of July scene. A stylized cartoon couple, based on the reference photo of Lao Lao and Jordan, are riding a thrilling roller coaster at Great America amusement park. Jordan has a comically terrified expression, eyes wide, mouth open in a scream, and hair flying straight back. Lao Lao is right next to him, laughing joyfully with her hands in the air, completely unfazed. Red, white, and blue fireworks explode beautifully in the background sky behind the roller coaster track. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Fourth of July\".\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, full-bleed abstract watercolor background for the left interior of a greeting card. The artwork consists of soft, blended washes of red, white, and blue, creating a dreamy, atmospheric effect reminiscent of a distant fireworks display at dusk. The colors flow into each other with organic paint bleeds and visible, artistic brush strokes. A subtle paper texture is visible throughout. The design is purely decorative, containing no people, text, or specific objects.",
    "rightInterior": "A decorative watercolor design for the right interior of a greeting card. The background features a soft wash of patriotic colors, blending from red at the top to white in the middle and blue at the bottom, with a subtle paper texture. Delicately painted watercolor stars and sparkles in red and blue are scattered around the edges, framing the central area. Integrated elegantly into the design, the following message is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Fourth of July, Lao Lao! I'm still not sure what was more explosive: the fireworks or my stomach after all those rollercoasters at the amusement park. Thanks for an amazing first trip there together and for being the best girlfriend a guy could ask for. Love, Jordan\". No people or characters are depicted."
