BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the fun and energetic tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a whimsical and heartwarming watercolor illustration style. The scene is bathed in the soft, diffused light of a sunlit sea, with gentle gradients of aquamarine, turquoise, and soft coral creating a dreamlike underwater world. The diving girl, styled after Lexie's photo, is rendered with a sweet, painterly touch, her hair flowing like seaweed in the gentle current. Beside her, a charming, rosy-cheeked octopus with large, friendly eyes offers a hug with its gracefully curved tentacles. The entire illustration is defined by soft, bleeding edges and visible water-stain blooms, giving it a handmade, organic feel. Delicate ink outlines, slightly imperfect and warm, add definition and character to the figures, making them feel like a cherished memory brought to life on paper. This style evokes a sense of joyful serenity and deep, personal connection, as if the moment was captured with love and a gentle brush.\n\n2.
