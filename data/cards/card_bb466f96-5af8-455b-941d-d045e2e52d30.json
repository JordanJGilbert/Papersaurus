    "backCover": "A minimalist watercolor design bringing peaceful closure. In the center, a single, elegant ballet slipper lies on its side, as if just taken off. A few loose, whimsical pink ribbons from the slipper trail gracefully across the page towards the left side, echoing the dance theme in a subtle, artistic way. The background is a soft, pale wash of color from the main palette, with delicate paint bleeds. The overall feeling is serene and quietly beautiful. The bottom-right corner is left intentionally empty. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor scene depicting a woman with light brown hair and a little girl with dark hair in a bright, sunny dance studio. The woman, Jasmine, is attempting an arabesque with a comical wobble, one arm flailing slightly for balance, a determined but funny expression on her face. The little girl, Vivi, watches with a giggle, one hand over her mouth, her own pose playfully mimicking the wobbly attempt. They both wear simple leotards. The background is soft and washed out, with a ballet barre and large windows letting in cheerful light. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday, Vivi!' is written in a beautiful, flowing, and legible handwritten cursive script. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. Key elements and faces are kept away from the edges for safe printing.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "An innovative and humorous watercolor illustration of a single slice of birthday cake, dramatically toppling over mid-air. A cartoon-styled fork is shown swooping in as if to heroically 'catch' it before it hits the ground. Playful, colorful watercolor splatters radiate from the cake, suggesting a messy, joyful explosion of frosting and sprinkles. The scene is lighthearted and unexpected, maintaining the card's funny tone without any characters. The background is a soft, neutral wash, keeping the focus on the dynamic, comical action. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "An artistic watercolor design framing the birthday message. Two elegant, cartoon-styled forks are crossed at the bottom center of the page, acting as a decorative base. From these forks, whimsical swirls of colorful 'frosting' painted in watercolor sweep upwards along the left and right sides, adorned with delicate, painted sprinkles that float around the text area. This creates a beautiful, unique border that perfectly complements the cake theme from the left page. Safely in the center, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script with a natural pen-style appearance: 'Vivi,\\nHappy Birthday! I hope your day is as graceful as my arabesque attempts... and that you get way more cake than I did after trying. Let's just say my balance is better when holding a fork.\\n\\nLove,\\nJasmine'. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture."
