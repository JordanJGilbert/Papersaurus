    "frontCover": "A beautiful and heartfelt watercolor painting for a greeting card front. The scene is set on the deck of a classic wooden Chinese junk boat, gently floating on calm, stylized turquoise waters under a soft, dreamy sky.\n\nIn the center of the boat, a warm and loving cartoon-style illustration of Grandpa, based on the man in the reference photo, is seated comfortably on a low wooden stool. He is depicted from the waist up, wearing a simple grey mock-neck sweater and blue pants as in the photo, and has a gentle, happy expression.\n\nOn his right, a cheerful cartoon version of Tong Tong, based on the child on the right in the reference photo, is sitting close to him, wearing a red sweater and brown pants. Tong Tong is joyfully pointing towards the water, sharing a happy moment with Grandpa.\n\nThe scene is creatively decorated with elements representing Grandpa's interests. Floating gently in the water around the boat are whimsical watercolor illustrations of various seafood items like a friendly crab, a delicate shrimp, and a colorful fish, all smiling. In the background, subtly blended into the soft sky, are the faint, elegant silhouettes of Chinese opera masks with flowing ribbons, adding a touch of cultural artistry.\n\nThe entire illustration is done in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paint bleeds and soft edges, creating a warm, nostalgic, and emotional atmosphere. The color palette is rich with teals, warm browns, soft reds, and gentle greys.\n\nCentered in the middle of the design, below the main subjects, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The text is colored in a dark, warm brown to complement the wooden boat. The composition is clean, focused, and flat 2D for printing.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference. Create a high-quality final version that:\n- Maintains the exact same composition, character positions, and overall design\n- Enhances details, textures, and color vibrancy\n- Corrects any minor imperfections or artifacts\n- Adds professional polish while staying true to the draft\n- Think of this as the \"final art\" version of the provided sketch\n\nORIGINAL CONTEXT TO MAINTAIN:\n- To: Grandpa\n- From: Tong Tong\n- Relationship: Grandpa is Tong Tong's Grandpa\n- Personal Traits to incorporate: Seafood, chinese opera, boats\n- Reference photos of: Grandpa in the middle, Tong Tong on the right",
    "backCover": "Minimalist back cover for a greeting card. A soft, full-bleed watercolor background in a gentle turquoise wash, with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds. In the top-center, a small, elegant watercolor illustration of a single, classic wooden Chinese junk boat sail, rendered in warm brown and soft red tones. The sail appears to be gently catching a breeze. The overall design is very clean and sparse, occupying about 20% of the space, with the bottom-right corner intentionally left clear. Flat 2D artwork for printing in a soft, flowing watercolor style.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior panel of a greeting card. A full-bleed background of a soft, gentle grey watercolor wash with visible paper texture. A beautiful, artistic arrangement of decorative elements cascades down from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right, covering about 40% of the panel. The elements include whimsical watercolor illustrations of a smiling crab, a delicate shrimp, and a colorful fish, intertwined with the elegant silhouettes of Chinese opera masks with flowing ribbons. The color palette is rich teals, soft reds, and warm browns, consistent with the front cover's aesthetic. The composition is purely decorative, with no text. Flat 2D artwork for printing in a soft, flowing watercolor style.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to hold a message. A very light, almost white, full-bleed watercolor background with faint, soft teal and gentle grey washes at the edges, creating an open and airy feel. A minimal decorative element, a single, elegantly painted watercolor shrimp in soft red and teal, is tucked into the bottom-left corner. This small illustration occupies no more than 20% of the total space, leaving a large, clean central area for a handwritten or printed message. Flat 2D artwork for printing in a soft, flowing watercolor style.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Dear Grandpa, \n\nHappy Birthday! Today would've been your 92nd birthday! I hope the weather is nice up there and you are eating all types of good food. I know you like seafood, especially stir-fried snails with perilla leaf. It is not in season for another couple months but maybe they have everything in season where you live. I probably would've made you some spaghetti with apple sausages or chicken because that's the only thing I know how to make well haha. I was sad yesterday that you are not here with us. Sometimes I wished I took you to eat at more places. It also made me sad to think you are all alone up there but then I remember that your parents and siblings are probably up there too. You'll be a great-grandpa in a few months! I dont know f you heard us, but Erica told you that she was pregnant when you were in the hospital. We miss you very much and I am sure grandma does too. Have a fun birthday!\n\nWith love, \nTong Tong\""
