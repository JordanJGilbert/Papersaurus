    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor painting that brings peaceful closure. The design features the single, giant, ornate picture frame from the front cover, now completely empty and leaning gently against a large, leafy green plant. The scene is calm, with soft light filtering through. The composition is focused on the left and center, leaving the bottom-right corner area completely clear and undecorated. The artwork uses the same soft color palette and watercolor style with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds, offering a quiet, artistic conclusion to the card's story.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor painting of a cartoon couple, Jordan and Lao Lao, styled with simplified, charming features. They are standing back-to-back in a playful, slightly dramatic pose inside a giant, ornate, empty picture frame that is sitting in the middle of a beautiful, sunlit field of wildflowers. Jordan, on the left, strikes a confident pose, winking, while Lao Lao, on the right, has a hand on her hip and is laughing. The overall scene has a soft, glowing light. Centered below them, written in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\". The style is whimsical watercolor with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. Key elements and faces are kept away from the edges.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "A highly creative and funny watercolor illustration depicting a ridiculously opulent, over-the-top gift box. The box is wrapped in shimmering gold paper with a massive, elaborate bow made of what looks like spun sugar or clouds. It's so large it barely fits on the page, with tiny, sparkling diamonds and stars floating around it, hinting at an impossibly expensive gift inside. The background is a soft wash of pastel colors. The tone is humorous and exaggerated, setting up the joke on the right page. The style is a consistent watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design featuring the funny and lighthearted message integrated into the artwork. The background is a soft, warm watercolor wash. In the center, the message is written in an elegant, legible, handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday to my wonderful girlfriend, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a ridiculously expensive gift, but then I remembered my presence is priceless. You're welcome! I love you more than anything. Love, Jordan\". The text is artistically framed by a whimsical, hand-painted 'PRICELESS' price tag that hangs from a delicate, painted ribbon at the top. The tag itself is decorated with subtle, shimmering gold leaf details, tying into the gift theme from the left page. The style maintains the elegant watercolor look with soft colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture."
