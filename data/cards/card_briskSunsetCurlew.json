To the right of the gift stack, a small, yellow, rodent-like creature with large ears and rosy cheeks is cheering enthusiastically, with a stylized lightning bolt symbol behind it. The background is a soft, textured wash of yellow and orange, with faint, blurred outlines of gym equipment like dumbbells and weight racks. The text \\\"Happy Buff-day!\\\" is prominently displayed at the top in a playful, brown, hand-drawn font, with \\\"Happy\\\" on the first line and \\\"Buff-day!\\\" on the second.
