    "backCover": "A simple, decorative back cover with a terracotta orange background. An old-fashioned, stylized compass rose is illustrated in the top center, with the cardinal directions replaced by friendship icons (a heart, a smiley face, etc.). The design is clean, leaving the bottom-right area open for a QR code. Flat 2D storybook style.",
    "frontCover": "A charming and whimsical storybook-style illustration. The scene is a stylized map, like a treasure map, with dotted lines leading to a central point marked with a big red 'X'. At the 'X' is a happy cartoon woman (Audrey). Her four friends are shown as cute, adventurous characters at the start of the path, holding a flag. The path is whimsical, winding past illustrated landmarks like 'The Giggle Garden' and 'The Caring Cafe'. A large, soft pink number '2' balloon is tied to the 'X'. The greeting 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a friendly, rounded font along the top curve of the map. The color palette is earthy and bright: terracotta orange, olive green, sky blue, and pops of sunny yellow.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent the people in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:\n- REPRESENT ALL PEOPLE: If multiple reference photos are provided, create cartoon versions of ALL people shown, bringing them together in the same scene\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles worn by each person in their reference photo\n- COMPLETE accessories: include ALL accessories visible on each person (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.)\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nThe balloon is a 2. Do not add eyeglasses to people.  Keep original people faces and clothes\n\nThe cartoon style should be charming and artistic while preserving complete visual accuracy to the reference photo. Every person in the reference must be represented with their exact appearance, clothing, and accessories.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed illustration depicting the 'treasure' at the end of the map: a cozy picnic scene. The four friends and Audrey are sitting on a large olive green blanket, sharing cake and laughing. The background is a gentle sky blue with fluffy white clouds. The entire scene is framed by illustrated green foliage and flowers in the corners, reinforcing the garden/park theme from the map.",
    "rightInterior": "A soft, sunny yellow background, reminiscent of aged parchment paper. The placeholder text 'MESSAGE GOES HERE' is centered and written in a charming, slightly imperfect, handwritten script in a dark olive green. A small, simple illustration of a red 'X' like the one on the front map is placed just below the text. Smart, storybook style."
