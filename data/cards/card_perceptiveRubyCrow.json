    "frontCover": "A dynamic, wide-angle comic book cover illustration. The scene is a high-altitude skydiving adventure with a humorous twist. James, from the reference photo, is depicted as a comic book hero, joyfully free-falling through a vibrant blue sky filled with fluffy white clouds. He's wearing his black t-shirt and black pants from the photo, now stylized as a superhero-ish suit, along with skydiving goggles pushed up on his forehead and a huge, excited grin. Jordan, from the reference photo, is strapped to his back in a tandem jump, wearing her blue top and black pants, looking comically terrified but also thrilled, with her mouth wide open in a scream-laugh. Instead of a standard parachute, a giant, colorful birthday cake with lit candles is deployed above them, its frosting and sprinkles catching the wind. The entire scene is framed with classic comic book action elements: bold black outlines, vibrant Ben-Day dots for shading, and dramatic motion lines streaking past them to emphasize the speed of their fall. In the center of the composition, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, the text reads \"Happy Birthday James\". The art style is flat 2D, with saturated colors and a high-energy, fun feel.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist comic book style illustration for a card's back cover. The background is a solid, vibrant blue, matching the sky from the front cover. In the top-left corner, a single, stylized, fluffy white cloud with a bold black outline is positioned. This design element is minimal, occupying about 20% of the space, leaving the rest of the vibrant blue background open. The bottom-right corner is completely clear. The artwork is flat 2D with a professional, polished finish, maintaining the comic book aesthetic."
