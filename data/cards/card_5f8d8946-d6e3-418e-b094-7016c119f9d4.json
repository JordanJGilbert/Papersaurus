    "backCover": "A simple and beautiful back cover for a greeting card, in a watercolor style cohesive with the front cover. The design features a continuation of the soft, pastel watercolor wash background with visible paper texture and gentle color bleeds. A single, delicate, sparkly rainbow-colored slime trail, identical to the one on the front cover, meanders gracefully from the top-left corner towards the center, fading out gently. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and unadorned, with only the soft pastel background wash. No people, no text, no characters. Flat 2D artwork, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds. Full-bleed background.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover for Sarah from John, in a beautiful watercolor style. A cute, cartoon illustrated brown-haired woman, resembling the reference photo, is gleefully riding a whimsical, oversized snail like a majestic steed. She wears a party hat slightly askew and holds a single, lit birthday candle like a tiny triumphant torch. The snail, also wearing a tiny party hat, leaves a sparkly, rainbow-colored slime trail behind it. The scene is set against a soft, pastel watercolor wash background with gentle color bleeds and visible paper texture. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday... ...to my favorite slow poke\". Flat 2D artwork, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative left interior panel for a greeting card, continuing the watercolor theme from the front cover. The design is an abstract full-bleed background of soft, pastel watercolor washes, featuring gentle color bleeds and visible paper texture. A beautiful, artistic pattern of tiny, whimsical party hats and sparkly, rainbow-colored swirls is scattered delicately across the page, concentrated more towards the corners and fading into the center. No people, no characters, no text. Flat 2D artwork, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds. Key elements are kept at least 10% away from the top and bottom edges.",
    "rightInterior": "The right interior of a birthday card, in a beautiful watercolor style. The background is a soft, pastel watercolor wash with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds. Decorative elements from the front cover, such as whimsical sparkly rainbow swirls and tiny party hats, elegantly frame the corners of the card. In the center, the following message is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script: \"Happy birthday, Sarah! They say you get wiser with age, but I'm just glad you haven't gotten wise to all my shenanigans yet. Here's to another year of me getting away with things and you being an awesome friend anyway! Love, John\". The text and decorative elements are positioned to be at least 0.5 inches from the left and right edges and 10% away from the top and bottom edges. No people or characters are depicted. Flat 2D artwork, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes."
