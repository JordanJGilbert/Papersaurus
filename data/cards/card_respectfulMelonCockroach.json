    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front cover, dreamy fantasy art style. In a whimsical, surreal landscape, Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo are transformed into cartoon characters. They are happily snowboarding down a magical mountain slope made of fluffy white rice. Instead of trees, the landscape is dotted with giant pieces of sushi\u2014a massive tuna nigiri here, a huge salmon roll there\u2014and oversized, juicy wagyu steak slices that stick out of the rice like rock formations. Flying alongside them are whimsical steamed dumplings with tiny wings, and floating rivers of code (like green Matrix-style numbers) meander through the scene like ethereal streams. Lao Lao is laughing as she hands Jordan a pair of chopsticks, and he looks thrilled, ready to grab a piece of flying food. The overall atmosphere is magical, playful, and humorous, with a pastel color palette and soft, ethereal lighting. Centered in a clear space in the sky, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The characters wear the clothing from the photo, but without any logos.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean back cover for a greeting card, in a dreamy fantasy anime style. A full-bleed, soft pastel gradient background reminiscent of a gentle sky at dawn. In the top-center, a single, elegantly illustrated steamed dumpling with tiny, delicate white wings floats serenely. The dumpling is rendered in a whimsical, 2D flat art style, with clean lines and subtle shading. The overall composition is very sparse, with ample negative space. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left completely empty for a QR code. The artwork has a professional, polished finish with enhanced details and vibrant, soft colors."
