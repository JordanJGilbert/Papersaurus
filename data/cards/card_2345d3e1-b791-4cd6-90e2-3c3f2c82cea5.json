    "backCover": "A simple and elegant back cover design that provides a peaceful conclusion. Against a soft coral pastel background, a single, whimsically illustrated dumbbell sits on the left side of the card. A lone, colorful resistance band is draped artistically over the dumbbell, echoing the workout theme from the front cover in a quiet, minimalist way. The style is clean and flat 2D, using the same color palette of teal, coral, and sunny yellow. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left completely blank and undecorated, with the design elements focused on the center-left. The overall feel is serene and subtly humorous, providing a gentle end to the card's story.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and vibrant flat 2D illustration for a birthday card. The scene depicts a group of diverse, stylized cartoon friends having a disastrous but funny attempt at a group workout. Characters, inspired by the reference, are in funny, exaggerated poses of effort and slight clumsiness, wearing mismatched, brightly colored retro workout gear. One character is comically tangled in a resistance band, another is struggling to lift a tiny dumbbell, and a third is attempting a yoga pose but has tipped over. The background is a simple, modern gym setting in soft pastel colors like teal, coral, and sunny yellow. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and flowing handwritten cursive script. The art style is clean, with bold lines and a playful, lighthearted feel. All key elements and faces are safely positioned away from the edges.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An artistic and unexpected full-bleed illustration for the left interior of a greeting card. The scene is a beautifully rendered, close-up, top-down view of a vintage record player turntable. The record on the platter has a custom label that, instead of a song title, features a stylized illustration of a creaking, rusty hinge with comical musical notes floating up from it. The color palette is a sophisticated mix of the card's primary colors: teal, coral, and warm yellow, with elegant black and silver details on the turntable. The style is flat 2D with a slightly textured, screen-printed look, creating a smart and witty visual pun on the idea of 'old sounds'. The mood is playful and clever, maintaining visual harmony with the overall card.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed page featuring a handwritten message in the center, framed by artistic and humorous decorative elements. The text \"Happy birthday! I was going to get you one of those cards that makes a sound, but I figured you hear enough creaking and groaning from your own joints already. Hope you have a fantastic day!\" is written in an elegant, legible, and flowing handwritten cursive script with a natural pen-ink feel. The message is framed by whimsical, stylized illustrations of sound waves emanating from illustrated cartoon joints \u2013 a knee and an elbow \u2013 complete with comical 'creak,' 'groan,' and 'pop!' sound effect words integrated into the sound wave lines. The color scheme is consistent with the rest of the card (teal, coral, yellow), creating a sophisticated yet funny design. The entire composition is balanced and artistically frames the heartfelt, humorous message."
