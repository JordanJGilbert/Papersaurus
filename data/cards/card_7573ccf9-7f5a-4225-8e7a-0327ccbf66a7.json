    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design. On a soft cream-colored background with visible paper texture, a single, beautifully detailed gold trophy ribbon, matching the one from the front cover's trophy, is depicted as if it's gently fallen onto the surface. The ribbon is rendered in delicate watercolor shades of gold and pastel yellow, with soft shadows. The overall composition is minimal and serene, with the decorative element positioned towards the center-left, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. The style is a watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, bringing peaceful closure to the card's theme.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor scene. An elegantly decorated, antique-style armchair sits empty in the center of a room. On the plush velvet seat rests a single, comically oversized, ornate golden trophy with a plaque that reads \"World's Oldest... Wisest Person\". Confetti and streamers in soft pastel shades of lavender, mint green, and pale yellow drift down around the chair. The background is a soft, light cream color with gentle watercolor bleeds at the edges. In the center of the image, floating just above the chair, is the text \"Happy Birthday\" written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is a lighthearted watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture.",
    "leftInterior": "An artistic and humorous watercolor illustration. A collection of ancient artifacts are displayed as if in a museum, each with a playful twist. A dinosaur fossil is wearing a party hat, an Egyptian sarcophagus has a birthday noisemaker sticking out of it, and a Grecian urn is overflowing with colorful, modern birthday confetti instead of olives. The artifacts are rendered in soft, elegant watercolor tones of stone grey, sandy beige, and terracotta, contrasted with the bright pastel colors of the party items. The background is a simple, light wash of cream, maintaining the lighthearted and sophisticated watercolor style of the card.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design focusing on the message. The text is written in an elegant, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script in a dark charcoal ink. The message is framed by a whimsical and decorative border made of oversized, colorful watercolor confetti shapes and delicate, curling party streamers in pastel shades of lavender, mint green, and pale yellow. A few stray pieces of confetti appear to have drifted onto the page, landing near the text. The overall design is clean and artistic, providing a beautiful backdrop for the heartfelt and humorous message. The background is a soft cream with visible paper texture, rendered in a watercolor painting style with soft, flowing colors and artistic brush strokes. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We were going to make a joke about how old you are, but decided we should respect our elders. Hope your day is as amazing as you are! Lots of love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\""
