A flat 2D cartoon illustration of Jordan, created from the reference photo, is shown joyfully struggling to hold a ridiculously oversized, melting ice cream cone with at least five scoops of different pastel-colored ice cream, sprinkles flying everywhere.

The background is a soft, minimalist wash of pale blue and sunny yellow watercolor, with artistic paint splatters and visible paper texture. In the center, the greeting \"happy birthday\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script in a dark teal color.
