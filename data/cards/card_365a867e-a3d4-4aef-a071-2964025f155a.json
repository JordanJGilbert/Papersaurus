    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor design that provides a peaceful conclusion. In the center-left area, a single, extinguished candle sits upright, a delicate wisp of whimsical smoke curling upwards from its wick. The smoke trail drifts gently towards the left, ending in a tiny, glowing heart painted in soft pink watercolor. The background is a very pale, clean watercolor wash of pastel yellow, echoing the front cover's warmth. The design is simple, elegant, and focused away from the bottom-right corner, which is left completely blank. The overall feel is quiet, artistic, and subtly humorous, with soft colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture.",
    "frontCover": "A charming and funny watercolor illustration. In the center, a large, ornate birthday cake sits on a vintage stand. The cake is absolutely covered with an uncountable number of lit candles, so many that they create a hilarious, brilliant glow. Four cute, stylized cartoon chipmunks (representing John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan) are standing at the base of the cake, looking up in comic bewilderment. One chipmunk uses a telescope, another has a calculator, a third is shielding its eyes from the bright light, and the fourth is fanning the cake with a large leaf to keep the wax from melting everywhere. The background is a soft, cheerful wash of pastel yellow and light blue watercolor, with soft paint splatters. In the center, above the cake, the text 'Happy Birthday' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and flowing handwritten cursive script. The entire scene has a warm, playful, and funny atmosphere, with soft flowing colors and visible paper texture.",
    "leftInterior": "An innovative and playful watercolor illustration. The entire page depicts an enormous, whimsical 'Awesomeness-O-Meter,' designed like a fantastical, old-fashioned carnival strength-tester. Instead of 'Weak' or 'Strong,' the levels on the meter are labeled with humorous compliments in a light, casual script: 'Pretty Cool,' 'Quite Fantastic,' 'Seriously Awesome,' and at the very top, 'Ageless Wonder,' where the indicator bell is ringing and surrounded by sparkling light effects. The meter itself is decorated with whimsical swirls, cogs, and splashes of vibrant watercolor in shades of teal, magenta, and sunny yellow, matching the card's overall palette. The background is a soft, textured watercolor wash. This abstract, object-focused scene is witty, imaginative, and visually engaging, setting up the joke on the right-hand page.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design that elegantly frames the birthday message. The handwritten text is the central focus, written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and flowing cursive script that feels personal and warm. The text reads: 'Happy birthday, Audrey! We've taken a vote, and it's unanimous: you're officially too old to count the candles. From now on, we'll just measure your age by how awesome you are (so, still ageless). We hope your day is as fantastic as you are! Lots of love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan'. The message is framed by a delicate, artistic watercolor border. This border isn't a simple frame, but rather a burst of celebratory confetti and abstract star shapes that seem to explode gently from the corners toward the center. The colors of the confetti match the card's palette\u2014teal, magenta, and sunny yellow\u2014with soft edges and paint bleeds. The background is a clean, light cream watercolor wash with visible paper texture, ensuring the text is perfectly legible."
