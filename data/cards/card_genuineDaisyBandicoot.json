    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a dark navy blue background. At the top center, the text \"Thank you\" is displayed in white. Below it, on a separate line, \"- AI for Good Conference\" is also in white. In the lower left quadrant, a stylized, abstract representation of a branching structure with small glowing dots of light appears, primarily in yellow, light blue, and faint green. This structure creatively integrates with and forms the beginning of the name \"Jessica\". The name \"Jessica\" is written in a modern, sans-serif font, with \"Jessic\" in a light blue-green gradient and \"a\" in white. Below \"Jessica\", the name \"Greenwalt\" is written in a larger, similar sans-serif font, with \"Greenw\" in a light blue-green gradient and \"alt\" in a soft pink gradient.

    "backCover": "Here are the detailed prompts for the greeting card, designed to flow chronologically and cohesively, with a unique interpretation for each section:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover design for a thank you card with a 'Smart Style' aesthetic, in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The artwork should be flat 2D for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds. The scene depicts the deep twilight sky, transitioning from a rich, dark navy at the top to a softer, almost indigo hue towards the bottom. Suspended in the upper-middle section of the frame, slightly off-center to the right, is a single, glowing orb of warm, golden light, emanating subtle lens flare and soft, rainbow-colored light streaks that fan out gently in a starburst pattern. This orb symbolizes a guiding light or a concentrated point of innovation. The overall mood is serene yet hopeful, with the deep, velvety darkness providing a stark contrast to the luminous central element. The artistic style is minimalist and evocative, focusing on atmospheric depth and the symbolic power of light against darkness. The greeting text \\\"Thank you - AI for Good Conference\\\" should be subtly integrated into the dark sky, perhaps as a glowing inscription or in a clean, modern font in a very pale, almost ethereal white or light gold, positioned to avoid the top/bottom 10% edges and 0.5\\\" from the left/right edges. No people or characters are present.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover design for a thank you card with a 'Smart Style' aesthetic, in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The artwork is flat 2D for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds. Continuing the theme of light and space from the front cover, the back features a vast, deep indigo night sky, mirroring the upper portion of the front. In the lower third of the frame, a subtle, soft wash of gradient color emerges, transitioning from a faint, hazy lavender at the very bottom to the deep indigo above. This gradient suggests the gentle emergence of dawn or the lingering glow from the initial light source. Faint, almost imperceptible specks of stardust or tiny, distant lights are scattered across the dark expanse, adding depth without being distracting. There is no text or any reserved space for QR codes. The design is exceptionally minimalist and serene, providing a peaceful and contemplative conclusion to the visual narrative. The artistic style is atmospheric and abstract, emphasizing the quiet vastness of space and the subtle interplay of dark hues.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior design for a thank you card with a 'Smart Style' aesthetic, in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The artwork is flat 2D for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds. This panel continues the theme of the deep twilight sky. The single, glowing orb from the front cover is now depicted as a slightly larger, more diffused source of light, positioned in the upper middle of the frame. From this central light source, thin, elegant, and almost thread-like beams of soft, rainbow-colored light extend outwards and downwards, gracefully curving and intertwining like delicate wisps of energy or illuminated pathways. These light strands are soft and luminous, with a subtle painterly texture. They create a visual representation of the 'path forward' and the 'conversation blooming'. The background remains a deep, rich indigo, providing a strong contrast for the illuminated elements. The overall composition is ethereal and dynamic, suggesting movement and connection. No text or people are present. The artistic style is sophisticated and abstract, focusing on the interplay of light, color, and form to convey the inspirational tone.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior design for a thank you card with a 'Smart Style' aesthetic, in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The artwork is flat 2D for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds. This panel is the emotional climax of the card's visual story. The deep indigo background from the previous panels is now subtly infused with a very soft, diffused glow towards the center. The 'seeds of progress' are visually represented by a cluster of small, bright, luminous points of light, varying in size and intensity, that appear to be growing and radiating outwards from the center. These points of light are interspersed with delicate, swirling lines of soft, pastel colors â€“ pale gold, rose, and a faint cerulean â€“ which represent the 'blossoming into meaningful change'. These lines and lights are not sharply defined but have a soft, ethereal glow.

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dark, deep blue background, presented in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The artwork is a stylized, abstract representation of growth and connection, inspired by neural networks or circuit board pathways. A central, upward-reaching structure resembling a tree or branching pathway is depicted, composed of thin, luminous lines in shades of electric blue, golden yellow, and subtle pink and white. These lines emanate from a complex root system at the bottom, spreading outwards and upwards to form branches. Along these branches, small, glowing orbs of light in similar colors act as nodes, some interconnected by the lines, others appearing as solitary points of illumination. A subtle, ethereal quality is achieved through a scattering of tiny, shimmering particles or stardust that permeates the background and trails along the pathways, creating a sense of energy and dynamism. The overall style is modern, sophisticated, and slightly cosmic, evoking a feeling of innovation, progress, and interconnectedness, fitting the \"AI for Good\" theme. There is no text present on this interior page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space, featuring a stylized, glowing, tree-like network of branches that originates from the left side and arcs across the top, with vibrant, energetic tendrils in shades of gold, teal, and magenta. The background is a deep, dark navy blue. The text, \"Jessica Greenwalt,\" is prominently displayed in a clean, modern sans-serif font, positioned above the main message body. The thank you message itself is presented in a slightly smaller, yet equally legible sans-serif font, occupying the central portion of the page. The branches frame the text without intruding on the reading space, creating an organic and visually dynamic layout. The overall aesthetic is futuristic and inspirational, with a focus on the luminous quality of the branches against the dark background, evoking a sense of growth, connection, and illumination. The composition is balanced, allowing ample space for personal handwritten notes below the printed message. The style is akin to a digital illustration with a luminous, almost electric quality, emphasizing innovation and forward-thinking. The color palette is rich and contrasting, with the bright, energetic branch colors standing out against the deep, sophisticated background."
