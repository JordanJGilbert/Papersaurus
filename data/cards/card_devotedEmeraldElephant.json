    "frontCover": "Flat 2D artwork for a greeting card, dreamy fantasy style with humorous magical elements. The scene is a whimsical snowy mountain landscape under a twilight sky with soft pastel clouds and shimmering stars.\n\nIn the center of the composition, an illustrated version of Jordan from the photo is dynamically snowboarding down a soft, glittery lavender-colored slope. He is wearing his tan hoodie and has a big, excited smile. A cartoon version of Lao Lao, wearing her light blue sweatshirt, is hilariously riding on his back piggyback-style, holding on with a joyful and slightly mischievous expression.\n\nTrailing them playfully down the slope is a parade of tiny, fluffy, magical dogs of various cute breeds (like corgis, shiba inus, pugs), each wearing tiny colorful winter scarves and some even sporting miniature snowboard goggles. They are kicking up sparkling, magical snow dust that swirls around the couple. The landscape is dotted with whimsical, glowing candy-colored pine trees.\n\nCentered on the card, floating in a clear area of the sky above the action, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" written in a beautiful, flowing, easy-to-read handwritten cursive script. The overall atmosphere is magical, funny, and full of ethereal light.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "Flat 2D artwork for the back cover of a greeting card, full bleed. In a dreamy fantasy anime style, an extremely simple and minimal composition. The background is a solid, soft lavender-purple, matching the twilight sky from the front cover. In the upper-left quadrant, there is a very small, delicate cluster of three shimmering, pastel-colored stars, subtly glowing with a magical aura. The composition is intentionally sparse, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty for a QR code. The artwork has professional polish, with enhanced color depth and texture, maintaining a whimsical and enchanting fairy-tale quality. Visual decoration is approximately 20% of the total area.",
    "leftInterior": "Flat 2D artwork for the left interior of a greeting card, full bleed. In a dreamy fantasy anime style, a subtle and complementary design. A beautiful twilight snowy landscape at the base of a mountain. The bottom third of the panel features a soft, glittery lavender snowfield dotted with a few whimsical, glowing candy-colored pine trees, echoing the front cover's scenery.

    "rightInterior": "Flat 2D artwork for the right interior of a greeting card, full bleed, designed to hold a written message. In a dreamy fantasy anime style, a minimal and elegant composition. The background is a very soft, pale pastel color gradient, transitioning from a light lavender at the top to a subtle, creamy off-white at the bottom, creating a large, clear, and serene space for text. A small, decorative border of tiny, whimsical, magical dog paw prints, rendered in a faint, sparkling silver, delicately frames the bottom edge of the card. The design is polished and professional, with a focus on creating an elegant, uncluttered area for a personalized message while maintaining the enchanting theme. Visual decoration is approximately 20% of the total area.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Hey Jordan,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to wrap myself up as your present, but I couldn't find a bow big enough for this much awesomeness. Instead, I'm just going to follow you around today pointing out that you're dating me\u2014you're so welcome.\n\nAll my love,\nLao Lao\""
