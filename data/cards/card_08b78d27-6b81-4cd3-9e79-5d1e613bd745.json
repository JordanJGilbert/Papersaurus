    "backCover": "A minimalist and enchanting watercolor design. A single, glowing yellow firefly is depicted in the center-left of the card, with a soft, radiating light effect against a deep twilight blue and purple watercolor wash background. A few delicate, swirling lines suggest its flight path. The bottom-right corner is left clear for a QR code. The style is moody and atmospheric, with rich, blended watercolor tones.",
    "frontCover": "An artistic and sweet interpretation in a charming 'story-book' watercolor style. The scene is set at dusk in a cozy backyard, with fireflies glowing around a young woman and a little girl with dark hair. They are holding hands, their other arms and legs extended in a simplified, gentle arabesque pose. Their silhouettes are painted against a dreamy, twilight sky. The focus is on their connection and shared happy moment. The color palette is a rich and deep scheme of twilight blues, deep purples, and soft lavenders, with pops of glowing yellow for the fireflies. The text 'Happy Birthday!' is elegantly lettered in a soft, glowing white script in the center. The style is layered watercolor washes, with soft flowing colors and visible paper texture.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "A whimsical watercolor illustration of two silhouetted figures, representing the woman and the girl, having a tea party on a picnic blanket under a starry night sky. A crescent moon smiles down on them. The teacups and teapot are painted in soft, glowing colors, contrasting with the deep blue and purple of the background. This directly references the 'Can\u2019t wait for another tea party!' line in the message. The style is dreamy and storybook-like.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor background that transitions from deep twilight blue at the top to a soft lavender at the bottom, mimicking the night sky. The placeholder text 'MESSAGE GOES HERE' is written in a graceful, flowing handwritten cursive script that glows with a soft, pale yellow, as if illuminated by moonlight. The text is placed centrally, framed by a few tiny, twinkling watercolor stars. The style is elegant and dreamy."
