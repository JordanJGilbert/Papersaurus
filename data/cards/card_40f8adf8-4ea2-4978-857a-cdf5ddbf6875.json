    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean comic book style illustration for a greeting card back. The design features a simple, bright yellow background with a subtle halftone dot pattern. Centered at the top, a stylized superhero emblem is shown, combining the letters 'J' and 'C' in a bold, blue and red graphic. The entire design has a thin, black panel border, consistent with the front cover. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and solid yellow for QR code placement. The overall style is flat 2D with bold outlines, maintaining the vibrant and clean aesthetic of the front cover. No people or text.",
    "frontCover": "A dynamic, energetic comic book cover illustration, flat 2D art style, for a birthday card.\n\n**Scene:** Two stylized cartoon superhero characters, inspired by the reference photos of Jordan and Craig, are in an action-packed, humorous scene.\n\n**Character 1 (Jordan):** Depicted as \"The Birthday Legend,\" striking a triumphant, dynamic superhero pose mid-air. Jordan is wearing a vibrant, custom superhero costume with a fun, slightly-too-large cape billowing dramatically. A huge smile is on their face, exuding joyful energy.\n\n**Character 2 (Craig):** Depicted as the loyal sidekick, \"Captain Craig,\" slightly below and to the side. Craig is humorously struggling to hold up a giant, beautifully decorated birthday cake that looks precariously wobbly, with candles lit and blazing. Craig has a comical expression of effort and concentration, looking up at Jordan.\n\n**Background & Style:** The background is a burst of vibrant, explosive energy, featuring classic comic book elements like a sunburst effect with bold radiating lines and halftone dot patterns in bright yellow and orange. The overall color palette is saturated and exciting\u2014think classic superhero comics with bold blues, reds, and yellows. The entire scene is framed with a black comic panel border.\n\n**Text Elements:**\n1.  A large, explosive comic book sound effect bubble, like \"KABOOM!\" or \"ZAP!\", is positioned near the characters.\n2.  A speech bubble from Craig's character says, \"Careful! I've got the cake!\"\n3.  In the center of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, and slightly bold handwritten cursive script, colored in a contrasting, bright color to stand out.\n\n**Overall Feel:** The artwork should have bold black outlines, vibrant flat colors, and a lighthearted, funny tone, perfectly capturing the energetic and exciting feel of a vintage superhero comic book cover.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

The text is centrally placed and reads:\n\n\"Jordan,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered that would make me old too. So instead, let's just agree we're both getting more distinguished. Hope you have an awesome day!\n\n- Craig\"\n\nThe overall design is clean, bold, and visually harmonious with the rest of the card, using the same vibrant color palette and comic book elements. No people or characters are included."
