    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card front. The scene features a cartoon caricature of Lauren, based on the reference photo, gleefully riding on the back of a slightly bewildered but friendly cartoon T-Rex dinosaur. Lauren is wearing a party hat, laughing, and holding a single slice of birthday cake with a lit candle as if it's a trophy. The T-Rex is also wearing a comically oversized party hat that is slightly askew. They are in a lush, prehistoric-style field with oversized, colorful flowers. The watercolor style is soft and flowing, with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. In the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday\". Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A simple and serene full-bleed background for a greeting card back. The design features a delicate watercolor painting of a single, oversized, colorful prehistoric flower, matching the style from the front cover. The flower is positioned in the upper-left quadrant, with its petals gently unfurling. The background is a soft, muted wash of color with a visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and subtle organic paint bleeds, creating a peaceful and harmonious feel. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated. Flat 2D artwork. No people or text. --ar 5:7",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful decorative interior for a greeting card, continuing the theme from the front cover. This full-bleed illustration features a gentle watercolor pattern of oversized, colorful prehistoric foliage and flowers cascading down from the top-left and bottom-right corners. The design is artistic and abstract, focusing on the soft, flowing colors, visible brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds characteristic of the watercolor style. The center of the card is a lighter, more open space, creating a sense of balance. The overall mood is lighthearted and cheerful. No people or text. Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and lighthearted interior for a birthday card. The background is a soft watercolor wash with a visible paper texture, consistent with the front cover. Delicate, oversized prehistoric flowers and leaves, rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with artistic brush strokes, tastefully frame the central area. Positioned clearly in the center, away from all edges, is the following message written in a beautiful, elegant, and exceptionally clear handwritten cursive script: \"Happy birthday, Lauren! I was going to make a joke about you getting older, but then I remembered I'm still older than you, so we'll just skip that part. Hope you have a day that\u2019s as awesome as you are!\\n\\nAll the best,\\nSam\". The text has high contrast against the background for maximum legibility. The decorative elements enhance the message without obscuring it. No characters or people. Flat 2D artwork. --ar 5:7"
