    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a vibrant, retro 8-bit pixel art style. The color palette is dominated by neon blues, purples, pinks, and oranges, with hints of green and yellow. The main subject is a friendly, pixelated dinosaur wearing oversized, angular sunglasses with pink frames and a rainbow gradient. The dinosaur is standing on a checkered floor with a grid pattern. To the left of the dinosaur is a retro computer printer emitting a stream of small, square cards, each with a pixelated smiley face on them. More of these smiley-face cards are scattered on the floor. To the right of the dinosaur is a clunky, retro computer monitor displaying the text \"LOADING STARTX.EXE\" in a blocky, green font. In the background, a large, glowing orange circle, reminiscent of a sunset or planet, is centered behind the dinosaur. Above the dinosaur, bold, pixelated text reads \"CONGRATULATIONS\" in a rainbow gradient, outlined in black. Scattered throughout the background are geometric shapes like cubes and pyramids in shades of pink, blue, and green, giving the image a synthesized, digital landscape feel. The overall mood is fun, celebratory, and nostalgic, evoking a 1980s arcade or synthwave aesthetic.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a pixel art, retro-futuristic aesthetic. The style is reminiscent of 80s synthwave visuals, with a dark, starry night sky and a grid-patterned foreground. The main subject is a stylized, slightly abstract printer with a vibrant, iridescent gradient across its front panel, transitioning from yellow to green to blue. Emerging from the top of the printer is a single greeting card, also rendered in pixel art, featuring a simple, pink pixelated heart on a light purple background. The background depicts a deep blue night sky with a crescent moon and scattered pixelated stars, including two distinct constellations formed by connecting dotted lines and small crosses. A stylized, vertical grid with colored lines frames the scene on the left and top edges, adding to the digital, retro feel. The overall composition is clean and focused on the printer and the card it outputs, creating a sense of closure by showcasing the result of the front of the card's implied action. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a retro, pixelated aesthetic, heavily influenced by 1980s synthwave and early computer graphics. The central focus is a large, anthropomorphic, bright green dinosaur in a dancing pose, rendered entirely in chunky pixels with yellow squares scattered across its body. The dinosaur is surrounded by a vibrant, chaotic explosion of confetti in various colors like orange, pink, blue, and yellow.\n\nDominating the background is a stylized, digital grid pattern in a deep purple hue, with glowing pink lines converging towards the center, creating a sense of depth and a \"digital tunnel\" effect. Overlaying this grid are numerous pixelated smiley face icons, each a circle with two dot eyes and a curved mouth, rendered in yellow with pixelated yellow, green, and orange highlights, appearing to float around the dinosaur.\n\nThe scene is further punctuated by several pixelated computer-style dialog boxes. In the top left, a box displays \"Error 404: Chill Not Found\" with a stylized \"X\" close button and an \"OK\" button, all in muted beige and blue tones with pixelated elements. In the top right, another box shows a pixelated yellow triangle warning symbol with an exclamation mark, labeled \"ERROR\". In the bottom right, a \"Success: Vibe Check Passed\" box is present, featuring a pixelated green checkmark and an \"OK\" button. These dialog boxes are framed with a light grey border and a blue title bar, characteristic of early operating system interfaces.\n\nThe overall color palette is saturated and electric, with strong contrasts between the bright green of the dinosaur, the vibrant confetti, the neon glow of the background grid, and the more muted tones of the dialog boxes. The artistic style is distinctly pixel art, with visible blocky pixels throughout the entire composition. The layout is dynamic and energetic, with the elements arranged to create a playful and visually stimulating scene that aligns with a fun, perhaps ironic or nostalgic, theme. The combination of the cheerful dinosaur, the error/success messages, and the overall retro-digital atmosphere creates a humorous and engaging visual narrative.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a retro computer window overlay. The window has a blue and purple gradient title bar with \"StartX\" in a white, sans-serif font, and minimize/close buttons. The main message area is a light purple with a faint speckle texture and small confetti dots in pink, blue, and yellow. The text is handwritten in a playful, flowing script, leaving ample room for a personalized message. Below the text area, there are two button-like elements: a blue \"OK\" button and a pink \"cancel\" button. The entire scene is set against a vibrant, swirling background of pink, blue, and purple, reminiscent of marbled paper or psychedelic art, with stylized greeting cards featuring a pink heart and a single flower scattered across it. The overall artistic style is flat and graphic with a slightly grainy texture."
