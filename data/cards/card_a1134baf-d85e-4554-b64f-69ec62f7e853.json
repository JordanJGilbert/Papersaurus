    "backCover": "A simple and elegant back cover for a greeting card, rendered in a soft watercolor painting style. The design features a delicate, abstract watercolor wash across the top third of the card, using the same light and airy color palette from the front cover. A few subtle, artistic paint splatters drift down from the main wash, creating a sense of gentle movement. The entire image has a visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds at the edges for an authentic, hand-painted feel. The background is a clean, light color. IMPORTANT: The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated for QR code placement.",
    "frontCover": "A funny and heartwarming birthday card front cover, in a flat 2D watercolor painting style. Two stylized cartoon characters, based on the reference photo of Lao Lao and Jordan, are the central focus. Jordan is playfully trying to lift Lao Lao up in a piggyback ride but is comically struggling, with bent knees and a strained, laughing expression. Lao Lao is on his back, laughing joyfully with her arms thrown wide in celebration. The scene is filled with soft, flowing watercolor colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges for an authentic hand-painted feel. In the center of the image, written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday\". The background is simple and light, keeping the focus on the funny, loving interaction between the two characters.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

I was going to get you a ridiculously expensive gift, but then I remembered my presence is priceless. You're welcome! I love you more than anything. Love, Jordan\". The text is the main focus, seamlessly integrated with the gentle, artistic watercolor decorations. The design contains no people or characters."
