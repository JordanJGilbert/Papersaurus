Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters.

Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a Pop Art style, reminiscent of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. The color palette is bold and graphic, dominated by bright blues for the background with a halftone dot pattern, contrasting with warm oranges and yellows. The central subject is a stylized, illustrated character of a man with dark hair, a beard, and sunglasses, wearing a patterned shirt and a black jacket. He is holding a potted cactus. Above his head, a yellow thought bubble contains an illustration of a brown wallet with a cactus design. The scene is set on a city street with simplified buildings, trees, and a car in the background, under a bright yellow sun. The overall mood is optimistic and aspirational. The text \"Happy month,\" is rendered in a flowing, handwritten cursive script in a creamy off-white color, positioned prominently in the lower center of the image, with ample safe space from the edges. The artistic technique uses flat colors, bold outlines, and a distinct halftone dot texture, creating a graphic novel aesthetic.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a love greeting card with a Pop Art style, featuring a minimalist yet impactful illustration on a vibrant yellow background. The primary visual element is a stylized, cartoon-like cactus. The cactus body is depicted in a bold, solid green with thick black outlines, showcasing its characteristic arms. The top of the cactus transitions into a pattern resembling a pineapple, rendered in a warm orange with a grid-like design. A subtle gradient effect using halftone dots is present where the green of the cactus meets the orange of the pineapple, adding a touch of retro graphic design. The overall composition is simple, with the cactus placed on the left side of the full-bleed background, leaving ample empty space on the right. There is no visible text or QR code placeholder, allowing for a clean and serene conclusion to the visual narrative.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a vibrant Pop Art style. The background is a dynamic pattern of thick diagonal stripes in bright pink and white. Scattered across the background are various \"explosion\" or \"starburst\" shapes in black, bright teal, and orange. Dominating the center of the page is a large, stylized illustration of a lightbulb. The lightbulb is rendered in a bright yellow with a pattern of small black dots, mimicking the halftone effect of classic comic book art. The filament of the lightbulb is depicted as a graceful, looping cursive line in black. The base of the lightbulb is a dark grey with two dotted circles. To the left of the lightbulb, there is a stylized illustration of a document or resume, featuring a circular icon with a person inside, and two bullet points represented by checkmarks. To the right of the lightbulb, a small, potted cactus is depicted. The cactus is a bright teal, with three segmented arms, and stands in an orange pot with small black dots. The overall composition is energetic and visually engaging, utilizing bold outlines and flat color areas characteristic of the Pop Art movement.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, retro Pop Art aesthetic. The background is a bold, bright teal canvas adorned with a repeating pattern of crisp white polka dots, reminiscent of vintage comic book printing. Dominating the center is a dynamic, starburst-shaped speech bubble in a radiant yellow. This bubble is outlined with a thick, black graphic stroke, giving it a comic book feel. Inside this yellow bubble, the message \"Write me that you will find a job and build your cactee startup turning cactus into a sustainable vegan leather\" is presented in a flowing, elegant, black cursive script. The handwriting is highly legible with natural variations in line weight, suggesting an authentic, handwritten feel. The overall composition is clean and graphic, with the yellow speech bubble and its message serving as the focal point against the energetic polka-dotted background, creating a playful yet impactful space for personal expression.
