    "frontCover": "Front cover of a retirement greeting card, featuring a vibrant and stylized cartoon illustration. The artwork is rendered in a bold, graphic style with clean lines and a bright, cheerful color palette dominated by blues, yellows, and greens. The main subject is a jubilant, feminine cartoon character, inspired by the provided reference, depicted mid-action on a stationary exercise bike. She is enthusiastically tossing a classic telephone headset into the air with one hand, while holding up a passport in the other, signifying her transition from work to travel. Her outfit consists of a camouflage-patterned top and light-colored pants. The background is split diagonally: the left side features a blue gradient with abstract representations of phone icons, alert triangles, and a single black high-heeled shoe, symbolizing her past work life. The right side transitions into a bright yellow, showcasing a stylized world map with iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, palm trees, and a silhouette of an airplane, representing her future travels and adventures. The text \"HAPPY RETIREMENT, TERESA!\" is prominently displayed across the top in a playful, slightly distressed, bold sans-serif font, with \"HAPPY RETIREMENT\" in a bright pink-purple and \"TERESA!\" in a slightly darker shade of the same color. The overall mood is humorous, energetic, and celebratory, conveying a strong sense of freedom and excitement for a new chapter. The composition is dynamic, with the character positioned centrally, drawing the viewer's eye immediately to her joyful expression and symbolic actions. The art style is reminiscent of modern greeting card illustrations, prioritizing clarity, character, and a positive, lighthearted message.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a retirement greeting card with a flat 2D illustrated style, featuring a simple yet innovative composition. The artwork depicts a stylized, vintage-style telephone handset in a bright pink, connected by its cord which forms a subtle, flowing heart shape in the air. This cord then leads to a circular emblem representing travel, with a globe outline and a small airplane silhouette inside, rendered in yellow and teal. The entire illustration is outlined in bold black, with a subtle shadow beneath the handset and emblem, giving a slight sense of depth. The background is a solid, pale cream color, creating a clean and serene finish. This design subtly references the front cover's narrative by symbolizing the transition from a connected, perhaps demanding, past (represented by the phone) to a new, free, and adventurous future (represented by the travel emblem and heart shape), providing a peaceful and memorable closure to the card's visual story. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a retirement greeting card, in a flat 2D illustration style with a vibrant, playful aesthetic. The background is a bright, consistent sky blue. A winding, bold pink road with dashed white lines travels diagonally across the entire image, from the top right to the bottom left. This road acts as a visual narrative path, symbolizing the journey of retirement. Along this path are various stylized, iconic elements. In the upper left, a bright yellow airplane is depicted, pointing upwards and to the right, suggesting travel and ascent. Further along the road, a turquoise silhouette of a person is captured mid-stride, running energetically. To the right of the runner, another turquoise silhouette of a person sits in a meditative lotus pose, embodying relaxation and well-being. Below the runner, a pair of turquoise dumbbells is placed, symbolizing a continuation of the fitness theme. To the right of the dumbbells, a stylized turquoise infinity symbol is shown. A prominent element in the lower-middle section is a turquoise computer error window, depicted with a sad, frowning face and a yellow warning triangle, signifying the end of work-related stresses. Following the road downwards, a turquoise cruise ship is sailing on a calm sea. At the bottom right of the image, a bright yellow sneaker with turquoise accents rests on the road, indicating continued activity and readiness for new journeys. The overall composition is clean, graphic, and filled with simple, bold shapes and a limited, cheerful color palette of sky blue, bright pink, yellow, and turquoise, creating a sense of lightheartedness and fun. The style is reminiscent of modern, clean-lined iconography with a touch of whimsical simplicity.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a retirement greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical, hand-drawn illustration style. The background is a soft gradient transitioning from warm yellow at the top to a light blue-green at the bottom. The central area is largely clear, designed to accommodate handwritten messages. Around this central space, a stylized, minimalist line art illustration in a vibrant magenta color depicts iconic travel destinations and symbols of newfound freedom. At the top corners, simplified airplanes are in flight, connected by swirling lines and starbursts. Along the left side, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is depicted, and on the right side, the Great Pyramid of Giza is shown. These landmarks are framed by playful, abstract shapes, curved lines, and scattered star motifs, suggesting a journey and celebration. A kettlebell, symbolizing her past work-life, is positioned near the bottom center, juxtaposed with the travel icons. The overall aesthetic is lighthearted and visually engaging, with the decorative elements carefully placed to enhance the message area without overwhelming it. The typography for the printed message uses a friendly, approachable serif font in a deep purple color, positioned centrally within the available space. The combination of travel landmarks, abstract celebratory elements, and the gradient background creates a cheerful and adventurous atmosphere."
