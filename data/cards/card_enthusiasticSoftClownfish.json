    "frontCover": "A whimsical watercolor illustration of a foodie paradise. In the center are cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, highly resembling the people in the reference photo. Lao Lao, on the left, is a young East Asian woman with long, dark brown hair, smiling warmly and wearing thin, round, gold-rimmed glasses and a black top. Jordan, on the right, is a young Southeast Asian man with a big, bright smile and spiky, dark, textured hair, wearing a maroon t-shirt. They are standing behind a table piled high with delicious food. Jordan is humorously attempting to stuff a giant bahn mi into his mouth, while Lao Lao laughs, holding a large cup of boba tea in one hand and a spoon for a steaming bowl of Chinese porridge in the other. Giant, anthropomorphic versions of a boba cup, a bahn mi sandwich, and a bowl of porridge with cartoon faces join the celebration around them, dancing and looking joyful. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds in a palette of warm, cheerful colors. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite snack, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean watercolor design for the back of a greeting card. The background is a soft, off-white with a visible paper texture. A single, small, elegantly painted boba cup, rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with organic paint bleeds, is positioned in the upper-left corner. The style uses warm, cheerful colors. The majority of the card, especially the bottom-right area, is left blank for branding and a QR code. Flat 2D artwork for printing.",
    "leftInterior": "A subtle and decorative watercolor illustration for the left interior panel of a greeting card. The design features a gentle cascade of food elements from the top-left corner, including a small, stylized bahn mi sandwich, a steaming bowl of porridge, and a cup of boba tea, all artistically rendered without faces or characters. The artwork is done in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, using a warm and cheerful color palette. The composition is light and airy, covering about 40% of the panel and leaving plenty of soft, off-white space. Flat 2D artwork for printing.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist watercolor accent for the right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to frame a handwritten message. In the bottom-right corner, there is a small, delicate watercolor arrangement of a single spoon and a tapioca pearl, painted with soft, flowing colors and artistic brush strokes. The background is a clean, off-white with a subtle paper texture. The decoration is minimal, occupying about 20% of the space, ensuring the panel remains open and inviting for a personal message. Flat 2D artwork for printing.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Hey Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! You're officially another year older, wiser, and even better at stealing my hoodies. I'm so lucky to have found someone as amazing as you, even if it means I have to share my snacks.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
