    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a dreamy fantasy birthday card for \"lao lao\" from \"Jordan\". The scene is a magical, whimsical beach at twilight. The sand is a soft, glowing pink, and the ocean waves are made of iridescent, swirling stardust in shades of lavender and teal. In the sky, a giant, smiling crescent moon hangs low, and constellations form the shapes of funny sea creatures like a crab wearing a party hat and a narwhal juggling tiny stars.\n\nIn the center, cartoon-illustrated versions of lao lao and Jordan from the reference photo are having a humorous moment. Lao Lao, wearing her light blue sweatshirt, is triumphantly holding up a giant, oversized seashell to her ear, listening with a look of comical amazement on her face. Jordan, in his brown hoodie, stands beside her, playfully trying to build a ridiculously wobbly sandcastle that is leaning like the Tower of Pisa, with a tiny flag made from a leaf on top. They are both laughing. The overall atmosphere is magical, ethereal, and lighthearted.\n\nIn the open space above them, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, glowing with a soft white light.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference. Create a high-quality final version that:\n- Maintains the exact same composition, character positions, and overall design\n- Enhances details, textures, and color vibrancy\n- Corrects any minor imperfections or artifacts\n- Adds professional polish while staying true to the draft\n- Think of this as the \"final art\" version of the provided sketch\n\nORIGINAL CONTEXT TO MAINTAIN:\n- To: lao lao\n- From: Jordan\n- Relationship: lao lao is Jordan's girlfriend\n- Personal Traits to incorporate: the beach\n- Reference photos of: lao lao left, jordan on the right",
    "backCover": "A minimalist flat 2D illustration for a greeting card back cover, in a dreamy fantasy anime style. The background is a soft, solid lavender color, fading gently from top to bottom. In the top-left corner, there is a small, elegant cluster of three glowing, iridescent seashells rendered in soft pinks and teals, with tiny, subtle stardust sparkles shimmering around them. The design is very minimal, occupying about 20% of the space, leaving the bottom-right area completely clear. The overall aesthetic is whimsical, magical, and cohesive with a twilight beach theme, but clean and simple.",
    "leftInterior": "A flat 2D illustration for the left interior panel of a greeting card, in a dreamy fantasy anime style. The scene is a serene twilight beach landscape with no figures. A full-bleed background shows the transition from glowing pink sand at the bottom to a calm, iridescent stardust ocean in shades of lavender and teal at the top. The bottom third of the panel features detailed, soft pink sand with gentle, wavy textures. Several small, elegant seashells and a single starfish are scattered naturally along the shoreline, glowing faintly. The overall composition is peaceful and magical, with decoration covering about 40% of the panel, primarily at the bottom to complement the main message area on the right.",
    "rightInterior": "A flat 2D illustration for the right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to hold a message. The background is a very soft, pale pink watercolor wash, providing a large, clean central area for text. Minimal decorative elements frame the corners. In the top-left and bottom-right corners, there are delicate, wispy arrangements of swirling stardust in muted lavender and teal, with a few tiny, soft white sparkles. These decorative elements are subtle, framing the space without intruding on it, and occupying about 20% of the panel. The style is dreamy, ethereal, and elegant, creating a beautiful and uncluttered backdrop for a heartfelt message.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my favorite person, lao lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! You're another year older, wiser, and somehow even better at stealing my fries. Here's to another year of adventures with you!\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
