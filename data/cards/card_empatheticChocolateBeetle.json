    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a charming watercolor artistic style. The color palette consists of warm browns for the otters, bright yellow-orange for french fries, a red and white striped container for the fries, and various shades of blue for the water and a light blue background sky. The main subjects are two adorable, anthropomorphic otters sitting closely together. The otter on the left wears black round-rimmed glasses and has a wide, joyful smile. The otter on the right is also smiling broadly and is in the process of eating a french fry. They are holding hands, and between them is a small red and white striped carton filled with french fries. The water is depicted with soft, horizontal brushstrokes. The text \"I Otterly Adore You\" is displayed prominently at the top of the card in a beautiful, flowing navy blue script font. The overall layout is centered and balanced, creating a sweet and affectionate mood and atmosphere. There are no overt decorative elements or patterns other than the subtle watercolor texture and the water ripples.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor artistic style. The background features a soft wash of light blue watercolor on the left side, transitioning to a clean, off-white paper texture on the right. Scattered diagonally from the top left to the bottom right are five loosely painted, golden-yellow french fries, rendered with soft edges and a subtle watercolor bleed effect. The fries are spaced out to create a sense of movement and lightheartedness, and there is ample white space on the right side, suitable for a QR code or a short message. The overall aesthetic is simple, playful, and complements a casual, food-themed card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a whimsical watercolor illustration depicting a large, appetizing pepperoni and mushroom pizza floating in a vibrant, starry galaxy. The background is a soft blend of blues, purples, and hints of pink, suggesting a nebula or cosmic cloud, with scattered small white dots representing distant stars. The pizza itself is detailed with visible pepperoni slices, mushrooms, and fresh green basil leaves, rendered with warm, inviting colors. In the upper right quadrant, a bright yellow, cartoon-style rocket ship is shown with fiery orange exhaust, blasting off into the cosmic scene. Scattered around the pizza and rocket are stylized yellow stars and small, green, four-leaf clover shapes. The overall artistic style is charming and playful, reminiscent of children's book illustrations, achieved through visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured watercolor effect. The composition places the pizza as the central focus, with the rocket providing a dynamic element and the celestial elements creating a sense of wonder and adventure, all within a visually harmonious color palette that balances warm pizza tones with cool cosmic hues.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a watercolor illustration of a border. The border is composed of stylized, golden-yellow french fries and small, circular meatballs or arancini, interspersed with delicate, pale yellow-green sprigs of leaves. The watercolor has a soft, organic feel with visible brushstrokes and some light blue and pink watercolor washes in the background behind the text. The main text of the card is in a elegant, black, flowing script font, which occupies the central area, leaving ample white space around it for a handwritten message. The design effectively balances the playful food theme with a refined aesthetic, creating a warm and inviting space for personal sentiment."
