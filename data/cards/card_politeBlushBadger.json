Within this glow, three stylized, thin, light blue lines flow in a graceful S-curve, punctuated by small, light blue circles at intervals, subtly evoking a sense of data pathways or technological connectivity. The overall composition is minimalist and serene, with the main visual elements concentrated in the bottom left, leaving the majority of the upper and right portions of the card blank.
