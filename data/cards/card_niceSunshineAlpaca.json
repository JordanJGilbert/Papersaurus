  "prompt": "Create 2 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing birthday greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\nðŸŽ¨ CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clichÃ© designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"Birthday!\"\nStyle: âœ¨ Smart Style\nTone: ðŸ˜„ Funny - humorous and lighthearted\nTo: Gejhs\nFrom: Gaba\n\n\nReference: \"artistic transformation\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages. If the user requests something potentially inappropriate, redirect to positive, wholesome alternatives that capture their intent in a family-friendly way\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n- Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: !in a whimsical and heartfelt Ghibli-inspired watercolor illustration style, capturing the subject from the photo with soft, rounded features and expressive, sparkling eyes. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of a late afternoon sun, with gentle, flowing colors and visible, delicate brushstrokes that give it a hand-painted, personal feel. Surrounding the character are floating, softly glowing birthday candles and whimsical, stylized botanical elements like gentle vines and blooming fantasy flowers, all rendered in a warm, inviting palette of sun-kissed yellows, soft peaches, and tranquil greens, creating a magical, joyful, and deeply personal celebration.\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D illustration in a playful, modern cartoon style. The background is a solid, soft teal color. At the top, in a warm, burnt orange, slightly textured, handwritten cursive font, is the text \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GEJHS!\". Positioned to the left of the text is a bright yellow, stylized vase with emanating yellow lines, suggesting light or energy. The central focus is on two characters. On the left, a character with short brown hair, wearing a light beige hoodie and a dark blue apron splattered with brown clay, is sitting at a pottery wheel. They have a comically stressed expression with wide, anxious eyes and furrowed brows, actively failing at creating pottery, with brown clay splattering outwards. Their hands and forearms are also covered in clay. To the right of this character stands another character with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a black tank top and brown pants, looking directly at the viewer with a subtle, amused smile. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with dominant tones of teal, brown, orange, and beige. The art style is clean, with thick black outlines and solid color fills, creating a friendly and humorous visual narrative.",
