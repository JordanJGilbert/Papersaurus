    "backCover": "A simple and artistic watercolor design bringing the card to a peaceful close. In the center-left of the card, a delicate watercolor illustration of two intertwined party hats, one slightly larger than the other, rests on a soft wash of color. A few loose, floating confetti shapes in pastel hues from the front cover drift gently around the hats. The background is a minimalist, soft cream watercolor wash with visible paper texture and subtle, organic paint bleeds at the edges. The bottom-right corner is left intentionally empty and undecorated, providing a serene and clean finish to the design.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor scene. In the center, a fun cartoon baby girl with a mischievous grin, representing the granddaughter, is holding a giant, comically oversized calendar planner. She's pointing a chubby finger at a specific date, which is circled with a bright red heart. Next to her, a stylish and happy cartoon grandmother character, representing Audrey, looks on with a surprised and amused expression, hands on her hips. They are both wearing matching, whimsical party hats. Floating around them are soft watercolor balloons and confetti. In the center of the image, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The background is a soft, cheerful watercolor wash of pastel yellows, pinks, and blues, with gentle paint splatters and a visible paper texture. The entire composition is playful and sets a lighthearted, celebratory tone.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An innovative and playful watercolor illustration. Two giant, overlapping birthday cake slices take up the majority of the page, as if they are two mountains in a landscape. One slice is decorated with elegant, classic swirls of frosting, while the other smaller slice has playful, colorful sprinkles. A single, whimsical candle with a gently glowing flame sits atop each slice. The background is a soft, dreamlike watercolor wash of complementary colors from the front cover, creating a humorous and artistic visual that ties into the shared birthday theme without using any characters. The style is painterly, with soft edges and visible brushstrokes.",
    "rightInterior": "The heartfelt message is the centerpiece, written in an elegant, legible, and warm handwritten cursive script. The text reads: 'Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are! Love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan'. The text is framed by an innovative and beautiful watercolor design: a whimsical, continuous ribbon of light, like a sparkling party streamer, swirls and loops gracefully around the message block. The ribbon subtly incorporates the pastel colors from the front cover, and tiny, delicate watercolor stars and dots are scattered along its path, adding a touch of magic and celebration. The background is a clean, soft white with a subtle paper texture, making the text and decorative elements pop. The overall design is sophisticated yet playful, perfectly complementing the humorous and loving message."
