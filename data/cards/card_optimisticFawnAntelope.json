    "frontCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio. A watercolor painting in a playful, humorous, and lighthearted tone. The scene depicts a stylized, cartoonish young man with glasses, wearing a cream hoodie and dark jeans, struggling to lift a barbell. He is sweating and straining, with sweat droplets illustrated around his head. Perched on the barbell, to his left, is a cheerful, iconic yellow creature with red cheeks and a lightning bolt tail. To the man's right, a stylized blue turtle-like creature with a shell is also part of the weight, looking tired or sleepy. Standing behind the man, with a supportive arm around his shoulder and a wide, encouraging smile, is a stylized young woman with short dark hair, wearing a black tank top and green cargo pants. The background is a warm, muted yellow and cream, with loose watercolor washes and paper texture. In the upper portion, bold, dark brown text reads \\\"LEVEL UP! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\\\". To the left of the text, there's a humorous illustration labeled \\\"SELF-PETTING DOG MACHINE\\\" with quirky, abstract mechanical drawings. To the right of the text, faint blueprint-like drawings of gears and mechanisms are visible, hinting at engineering. The overall color palette is warm, with yellows, creams, muted blues, and greens, rendered with soft watercolor brush strokes and organic paint bleeds. The style is a charming, simplified cartoon illustration. Important: Ensure text is positioned safely away from the top/bottom edges (at least 10% margin) and 0.5\\\" from left/right edges. Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. Avoid generic designs; aim for unique and memorable.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio. A continuation of the watercolor painting style. The scene is simple and serene, providing a peaceful resolution. The background features soft, warm watercolor washes in shades of cream, muted yellow, and faint hints of blue, with visible paper texture and subtle organic paint bleeds, consistent with the front cover. The design incorporates subtle, unexpected artistic elements inspired by the front cover's themes, but without any characters or text. This could include abstract, stylized watercolor shapes reminiscent of gears or energy bursts, or a gentle, blurred depiction of a simplified weight plate with subtle color gradients. The focus is on a quiet, artistic closure that complements the overall card's aesthetic. Ensure no people or text are present. Maintain the watercolor style with soft flowing colors and artistic brush strokes.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior page of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio. Unleash creative freedom for an innovative and unexpected visual. Maintain the watercolor painting style with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The tone should be humorous and lighthearted. This section can include scenes, objects, patterns, or abstract art that complements the overall narrative and theme of 'leveling up', working out, and engineering, without featuring people or characters. For instance, a whimsical watercolor illustration of a character's journey to \\\"level up,\\\" represented by stylized metaphorical hurdles or abstract representations of progress. This could involve vibrant, playful watercolor patterns inspired by circuits, gears, or abstract energy flows, rendered in the same warm color palette as the front cover. The goal is to create something genuinely surprising and memorable that doesn't rely on characters, showcasing bold artistic choices while harmonizing visually with the rest of the card.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The design features a soft, textured background with subtle washes of light blue and gray, mimicking paper texture. In the center, there are two small, abstract watercolor splatters: one in a vibrant yellow in the upper left, and another in a muted blue in the lower right.

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a whimsical, steampunk-inspired watercolor illustration. The image depicts a stylized, disassembled spherical object resembling a PokÃ© Ball, revealing intricate, golden clockwork mechanisms within its two halves. One half shows a collection of gears, springs, and levers, with a small, ornate key resting nearby. The other half displays a similar intricate arrangement of gears and a delicate escapement mechanism. Scattered around these central components are smaller gears and mechanical parts. The entire scene is rendered in a soft watercolor style, with visible brushstrokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds in warm golden, brassy tones, with accents of muted red and grey, all set against a pale blue grid background that suggests a blueprint or technical drawing. The composition is balanced and detailed, showcasing a clever fusion of pop culture and mechanical artistry.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a humorous and lighthearted tone, rendered in a watercolor painting style. The entire page is filled with subtle, monochromatic grey watercolor illustrations of engineering and workout motifs. Delicate, line-art-like watercolor strokes depict various gears, circuit board patterns, and stylized weights (dumbbells and kettlebells) scattered across the background with organic paint bleeds and soft textures. The central area is deliberately kept clear to accommodate a handwritten message, with the printed text \"Happy Birthday Garret! You can finally rent a car without the extra fees! Sorry I you have to spend your birthday in the state that shall not be named, but who celebrates on their actual birthday anyways. I cannot wait to see you and celebrate your belated birthday with you.
