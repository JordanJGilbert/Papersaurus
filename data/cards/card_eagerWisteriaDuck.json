BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the motivating and uplifting tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements.

I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a luminous and ethereal watercolor style, depicting two overlapping silhouettes. The background silhouette, rendered in soft, muted grays and cool blues, subtly evokes past struggles, like a fading memory. Emerging from it, the foreground silhouette is vibrant and alive with a radiant kintsugi effect, where delicate, glowing gold leaf lines trace the contours, symbolizing the beautiful mending of past wounds into sources of strength. The surrounding space is filled with a gentle wash of warm, celebratory colorsâ€”peach, soft rose, and sunny goldâ€”blending seamlessly into one another. Delicate, hand-painted wildflowers, like resilient poppies and joyful sunflowers, appear to grow from the golden lines, symbolizing new growth and blossoming self-love. The overall effect is deeply personal, tender, and triumphant, capturing the beauty of a soul gratefully acknowledging its own journey.\n\n2.

    "frontCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a stylized, illustrative art style reminiscent of a warm, vintage comic book or animation. The color palette is dominated by deep, textured browns and oranges for the seating and background, contrasting with warm golden yellows emanating from the upper portion of the image, creating a sense of triumph and illumination. The foreground features a young woman with long, dark hair, a confident smile, and dark eyes, wearing a dark top and simple jewelry, holding a small, square card that reads \\\"self-creation begins here.\\\" She is seated at a table, suggesting a moment of reflection or a new beginning. Behind her, and slightly above, are two figures: a younger, determined-looking woman in a dark outfit, wielding a mallet and chisel, actively sculpting a rough form. Emerging from this sculpted form is a luminous, serene, ethereal female silhouette glowing with golden light, representing the accomplished self. The overall mood is inspirational and empowering, capturing a journey of transformation and self-made success. The text \\\"congratulations\\\" is displayed at the very top in a flowing, elegant, slightly golden handwritten script.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a simple, elegant design. It features a subtle, textured background in warm, muted tones, hinting at the overall aesthetic of the card. In the center-left area, a single, stylized, glowing golden wildflower, similar to those subtly suggested in the interior, is depicted with delicate brushstrokes. The rest of the background is largely clear, with the bottom-right corner intentionally left blank and undecorated to accommodate a QR code. The mood is serene and conclusive, providing a quiet artistic finish that complements the card's inspirational theme without being overly elaborate. No text or characters are present.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card, continuing the visual narrative with a warm, textured, illustrative art style. The background transitions from darker tones at the bottom to a bright, radiant golden glow at the top, symbolizing progress and achievement. Abstract, swirling shapes in soft, muted yellows, oranges, and hints of gold evoke the feeling of overcoming past struggles and embracing a brighter future. Delicate, almost ethereal lines of glowing gold trace abstract contours, suggesting resilience and inner strength. Scattered amongst these abstract elements are stylized, hand-painted wildflowers, such as small poppies and abstract sunflower shapes, rendered in warm peach and rose hues, symbolizing growth and blossoming self-love. The overall impression is one of gentle transformation and the unfolding of potential, maintaining a cohesive, uplifting, and inspirational tone with a focus on abstract, symbolic representation. No text or characters are present.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card, serving as the climax of the visual story. The art style is consistent with the rest of the card: warm, illustrative, with textured backgrounds and a prominent golden glow. The central focus is the message \\\"Thank you for gifting me with a great future and present and past\\\" rendered in a beautiful, flowing, legible handwritten cursive script in a rich, dark ink, appearing as if written with a calligraphy pen. This message is elegantly framed by abstract, organic decorative elements that echo the golden, luminous lines and subtle wildflower motifs from the left interior. These decorative elements are rendered in soft washes of peach, rose, and gold, creating a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing composition that enhances the heartfelt message. The overall mood is deeply personal, celebratory, and grateful, providing an emotional peak for the card's narrative.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist and serene artistic style. The composition features a gentle, almost ethereal wash of soft peach and cream colors that blend seamlessly into a pale yellow background, creating a warm and calming atmosphere. A single, stylized, luminous yellow square, textured like a small gem or a perfectly crafted building block, is centrally placed on the open palm of a subtly rendered, neutral-toned hand. This hand, depicted with soft shading and gentle curves, appears to be offering or holding this precious element. The overall aesthetic is extremely clean and uncluttered, conveying a sense of peace and quiet accomplishment. There is no text, and the design elements are concentrated towards the center and left, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear, as if reserved for a QR code. This design serves as a simple yet sophisticated conclusion, subtly echoing the theme of holding something precious and valuable, a quiet culmination of the card's inspirational journey. The style is flat 2D artwork for printing, with a full-bleed background.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a congratulations greeting card with a dynamic, abstract swirling design. The artwork is rendered in a thick, impasto-like oil painting style, with visible brushstrokes creating a textured, almost mosaic-like appearance. The composition features a powerful central vortex, beginning in the lower left and spiraling upwards and towards the right. This vortex is a brilliant, radiant glow of warm colors, dominated by vivid oranges, bright yellows, and golden hues, suggesting energy and a bright future. As the spiral moves outward, it transitions into cooler tones of deep teal, earthy browns, and dark, shadowy blues on the outer edges, creating a sense of depth and the overcoming of challenges. The elements are arranged in semi-circular, segmented patterns, reminiscent of stained glass or layered tiles, with distinct outlines between each color block. This creates a highly stylized and graphic feel, yet the painterly texture keeps it warm and artistic. The overall mood is one of energetic transformation and triumphant emergence from darkness into light. The color palette is a harmonious blend of warm and cool tones, unified by the bold brushwork and the central radiating light. There is no text or characters on this interior page. The design is full-bleed with a 9:16 aspect ratio.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with handwritten text. The background is a soft, blended wash of peach and orange watercolor, creating a warm and luminous feel. Dominating the center of the page is the handwritten message, \"Thank you for gifting me with a great future and present and past,\" rendered in a beautiful, flowing, teal-colored cursive script. The typography is elegant, legible, and has a natural, heartfelt character with slight variations in line weight, evoking sophisticated calligraphy. The design is framed by decorative elements on the top left and bottom right corners. These decorative elements consist of a mosaic-like pattern of small, square tiles in vibrant blues, teals, and oranges, outlined with delicate gold. Some tiles are arranged in a denser, tessellated pattern near the corner, while others scatter outwards, appearing to float and fade into the watercolor background. This decorative framing creates a sense of depth and artistry without overwhelming the central message space, allowing the handwritten text to be the focal point. The overall aesthetic is inspirational, sophisticated, and deeply personal, with the mosaic motif symbolizing a beautiful, pieced-together journey."
