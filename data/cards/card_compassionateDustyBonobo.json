    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D artwork, full-bleed background in a very light cream or off-white color. The artwork features a stylized, geometric illustration of two birds perched on minimalist branches against this plain background. The birds are depicted in simple, rounded shapes with flat planes of color. The bird on the left is primarily a medium gray with a darker gray wing and a lighter gray head. Its beak is a small, sharp triangle of golden yellow. The bird on the right has a dark navy blue head and chest, with a medium gray body and wing. Its beak is also golden yellow. The branches are abstract and linear, rendered in a dark navy blue, forming a simple, asymmetrical tree structure. The text \"HAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY\" is placed centrally, vertically stacked. \"HAPPY\" and \"FIRST\" are in a sophisticated, sans-serif font in a muted gold color. \"ANNIVERSARY\" is in a slightly larger size of the same font and color. The overall mood is serene, elegant, and slightly whimsical, with a clean, modern aesthetic. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye to the birds and the central text. The style is minimalist and graphic, using a limited color palette of off-white, medium gray, dark navy blue, and golden yellow.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist and sophisticated aesthetic. The background is a solid, creamy off-white color with a subtle paper texture. Centered on a thin, dark navy blue horizontal line is a simple, stylized illustration of a sprout emerging from a seed. The sprout has a slender, light brown stem that curves upwards, bifurcating into two delicate leaves. One leaf is a muted golden yellow, and the other is a deep navy blue, mirroring the horizontal line. The seed is depicted as a smooth, oval shape in a medium grey, outlined in the same dark navy blue as the line. This design is clean, symbolic of growth and beginnings, and subtly echoes the colors and motifs of the front and interior of the card, providing a peaceful and understated resolution to the visual narrative. There is no text or QR code present on this back cover.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a sophisticated and abstract design. The artwork features flowing, parallel lines in a deep navy blue and a muted gold. These lines create dynamic, wave-like patterns that gracefully curve and overlap across the page. The background is a soft, creamy off-white, providing a clean and elegant contrast to the linear elements. The composition is balanced, with the converging and diverging lines suggesting movement and connection. The overall aesthetic is modern, minimalist, and conveys a sense of understated elegance and professionalism, fitting for a formal business context. There is no text or imagery of people present.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a formal and sophisticated aesthetic. The background is a soft, creamy off-white, reminiscent of high-quality paper. The interior features an abstract, flowing decorative element composed of thin, elegant lines in dark navy blue and a warm, metallic gold. These lines begin at the bottom and sweep upwards and outwards, creating a dynamic yet subtle border that frames the central text area. The lines are interwoven and organic, suggesting a sense of connection and progress. The text, including the greeting \"John,\" the body of the message, and the closing \"With deepest respect, Jordan,\" is presented in a clean, sans-serif font in a dark, legible color. The typography is centered, occupying the majority of the vertical space, with ample room left and right for personal handwritten additions. The overall impression is one of refined elegance and professionalism, with the decorative elements enhancing, rather than overwhelming, the message. The style is flat 2D artwork, suitable for printing, with a full-bleed background."
