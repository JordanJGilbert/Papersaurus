  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing congratulations greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clich\u00e9 designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special.

It's giving main character energy with the god-tier grades and leveling up in every single subject. You even went conference hunting?! The academic glow-up is real, periodt. Slay!\n\n- Neelu\"\n\nReference: \"artistic transformation\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the internet memes, chaotic energy, and unhinged vibes tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages. If the user requests something potentially inappropriate, redirect to positive, wholesome alternatives that capture their intent in a family-friendly way\n\n- Include GenZ visual elements like chaotic energy, internet meme references, bold contrasting colors, and unhinged but endearing visual style\n\n\n\n\n- Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"congratulations\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a vibrant and energetic illustrated comic book pop art style. The design features a dynamic \"before and after\" split panel. On the left, a slightly desaturated, sketched version of Suhaan is shown surrounded by textbooks, captioned \"Last Year.\" On the right, a full-color, boldly-inked hero version of Suhaan bursts forth, glowing with a golden aura of \"main character energy.\" He's surrounded by stylized, explosive bursts and sound effects like \"KAPOW!\" for amazing grades, \"ZAP!\" for up-leveling in subjects, and \"BOOM!\" for seeking out conferences. The background is filled with a bright, celebratory sunbeam pattern, and the entire piece has a hand-drawn, screen-printed texture, giving it a warm, tactile, and personal feel that celebrates his epic \"glow-up\" with joyful, artistic flair.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! You have complete creative freedom to design whatever you want for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a congratulations card with internet memes, chaotic energy, and unhinged vibes tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description. Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before!

Slay!\n\n- Neelu\" positioned safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image) integrated into beautiful, innovative decorative artwork. HANDWRITING STYLE: Write the message in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. The handwriting should be legible, flowing, and have natural character - not overly perfect but graceful and warm. Use a nice pen-style appearance with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight. Think of sophisticated calligraphy that's still approachable and easy to read. Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters.

IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.
