    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a vibrant and energetic illustrated comic book pop art style. The design features a dynamic split panel. On the left, a stylized cartoon character resembling a young person, with wide, anxious eyes and slightly furrowed brow, is depicted in a desaturated, sketched style. This character wears a black button-down shirt and has hands raised in a gesture of mild confusion or overwhelmedness. Above this character are two books, one red labeled \\\"Math\\\" and one green labeled \\\"Science,\\\" also in a slightly faded, sketched style. The text \\\"LEVEL 1 SUHAAN\\\" is displayed in bold, pixelated, white capital letters above the left panel. The background on the left is a dark blue, with faint, stylized circuit board patterns in neon blue and pink. On the right side of the split panel, the same stylized cartoon character is depicted with a bright, confident smile, transformed into a \\\"hero\\\" version. This character glows with a subtle golden aura and holds a golden trophy with both hands. Above this character, the text \\\"GRADE-UP! KNOWLEDGE UNLOCKED! CONFERENCE QUEST COMPLETE!\\\" is displayed in bold, pixelated, yellow capital letters with a slight glow. The background on the right is also dark blue with similar neon circuit board patterns, but they appear more vibrant and energetic, with brighter pinks and oranges. The word \\\"congratulations\\\" is prominently displayed across the bottom of the card in large, bold, white pixelated text with a glowing cyan and magenta outline, evoking a retro video game aesthetic. The overall mood is one of transformation and achievement, captured in a playful, exaggerated comic book style with a distinct GenZ visual language.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a vibrant and energetic illustrated comic book pop art style. The design is a subtle continuation of the front cover's theme, focusing on minimalist, abstract geometric patterns. The background is a deep, dark blue, transitioning into streaks of neon pink, purple, and electric blue, reminiscent of digital data streams or light trails. These patterns are rendered with a clean, stylized linework, suggesting technological advancement. In the center-left area, subtle, stylized representations of achievement motifs like faint golden starbursts or small trophy outlines are integrated into the pattern, hinting at the character's success without being explicit. There is no text. The bottom-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square area, is completely clear and undecorated to reserve space for a QR code. The overall mood is serene yet technologically infused, providing a quiet, artistic conclusion to the celebratory narrative.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior spread of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a vibrant and energetic illustrated comic book pop art style.

A stylized cartoon character, mirroring the one on the front cover, is depicted with a look of mild distress and confusion, hands spread wide. This character is surrounded by an abundance of stylized, open textbooks in muted colors. The text \\\"Last Year.\\\" is clearly written in a clean, sans-serif font above this figure. The background is a deep, muted blue with faint, less vibrant circuit board patterns and scattered digital static effects.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. The background is a deep, matte navy blue, subtly patterned with faint, thin, light blue circuit board lines and small circular nodes. Centered on the left half of the card, there is a glowing, pixelated heart icon in a vibrant, gradient pink and magenta. The heart emits a soft, ethereal purple glow that fades into the dark background. This design subtly references the \"main character energy\" or \"glow-up\" theme from the front, possibly representing the recipient's heart or achievements in a minimalist, digital-art style. There is ample clear space on the right side of the card for a QR code. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and slightly futuristic, providing a serene conclusion to the card's narrative. The style should be a flat 2D illustration with a subtle screen-printed texture, consistent with a \"smart style\" and GenZ humor, but expressed here in a more subdued and abstract manner than the front or interior. No text or characters are present on the back cover.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a vibrant, energetic, and neon-infused tech-inspired illustrative style. The background is a dark, cosmic expanse filled with subtle digital grid lines and scattered glowing particles, evoking a \"hacking\" or \"data stream\" aesthetic. Dominating the center is a stylized, glowing network of interconnected lines in electric blue, hot pink, and lime green, resembling a circuit board or a futuristic neural network. This network emanates from a central bright point and branches outwards, connecting to stylized, iconic representations of academic achievements. On the left, a glowing lightbulb icon labeled \"CRITICAL THINKING\" is connected by a vibrant blue line. Below this, a simple, bold \"MATH\" label is connected by another blue line. On the right, a neon teal magnifying glass icon labeled \"RESEARCH SKILLS\" is linked by a green line, and below that, a glowing green globe icon represents \"SOCIAL STUDIES,\" also connected by a green line. At the very top, a bright, golden trophy icon with a neon glow is labeled \"CONFERENCE HUNTER\" and is the apex of this interconnected visual structure. The overall impression is one of sharp, digital growth and achievement, visually representing the \"leveling up\" in subjects with a high-tech, abstract flair that aligns with the requested chaotic, unhinged, but smart GenZ aesthetic.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a dark, textured background resembling a starry or digital nebula. The central area is enclosed by a stylized, glowing border with dual-tone neon lines, primarily in a bright cyan and a warm gold. This border has sharp, geometric angles and rounded corners, with decorative elements at the corners resembling simplified icons: a lightbulb on the left and a globe on the right at the top, and a stylized flask on the left and a sprout on the right at the bottom. Above the main message area, the word \"VICTORY\" is prominently displayed in a bold, sans-serif font with a glowing effect, matching the border colors. The main message is written in a flowing, elegant, handwritten cursive script with a slightly imperfect, natural pen-like texture, predominantly in white with subtle highlights. The text occupies the majority of the central framed area, leaving ample space for readability. The overall aesthetic is sleek and modern, with a touch of futuristic or academic symbolism, hinting at intelligence and achievement. The interior spread would continue this theme with a cohesive artistic vision."
