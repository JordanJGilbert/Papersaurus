    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a soft, luminous watercolor illustration style, featuring gentle ink outlines. The background is a wash of pale yellow and light sky blue, creating a serene and airy atmosphere. In the upper left quadrant, a single, simplified, charming green cartoon dinosaur footprint is depicted, rendered with a subtle gradient of green and a slightly darker green outline. This element subtly references the front cover without being a direct repeat. The majority of the back cover is left intentionally clear and undecorated, particularly the bottom right corner, which is a blank space approximately 1 inch square, intended for a QR code. The overall design is minimalist and peaceful, providing a complementary and understated conclusion to the visual narrative.\n\nThe core idea is to create a feeling of a single, gentle footprint, a subtle reminder of the dinosaur from the front, left in a serene, soft-focus background. The absence of the dinosaur itself or any other prominent elements focuses on a quiet, artistic resolution. The colors are consistent with the light, airy palette of warm pastels, maintaining the established mood. The style remains painterly and light, with visible brushstrokes implied. The placement of the footprint is to the upper left, leaving ample clear space, especially in the crucial bottom right corner for the QR code. There is no text on the back cover.",
