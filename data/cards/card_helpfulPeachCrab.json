IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.

The background is a deep purple-blue night sky filled with soft, twinkling stars and abstract, wispy clouds in pastel pinks and blues. Floating in the upper left are luminous, translucent jellyfish-like creatures with delicate tendrils. In the upper right, a stylized, swirled planet with pastel colors is visible. The central focus is on two \\\"whimsical characters\\\" with \\\"simplified, friendly features\\\" riding on the back of a fluffy, white, moth-like creature with large, bright blue eyes and iridescent, feather-like wings. The character on the left has dark, curly hair, is winking, and wearing a black top with a geometric pattern in white. The character on the right has light brown hair, wears a beanie and an orange shirt, and is pointing excitedly upwards with their tongue sticking out playfully. The text \\\"Happy Birthday Sunny\\\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, \\\"handwritten cursive script\\\" in a soft yellow-golden color, positioned centrally and clearly readable, avoiding the top and bottom 10% edges.

In the center-left area, there are faint, luminous outlines of the same jellyfish-like creatures from the front cover, appearing more ethereal. The \\\"fluffy, white, moth-like creature\\\" from the front is subtly suggested as a faint, luminescent outline or a gentle, soft texture flowing across the bottom, with hints of its iridescent wings. The right bottom corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely clear and undecorated for a QR code. The overall design is \\\"minimal\\\" and \\\"serene,\\\" offering a \\\"peaceful closure\\\" with \\\"unexpected artistic elements\\\" that echo the front cover's magic without being overly detailed or complex.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a dreamy fantasy anime style. The background is a deep twilight blue transitioning to a soft lavender at the bottom. Scattered across the sky are numerous small, stylized stars, some with a subtle sparkle effect. Dominating the composition is a large, delicate feather, rendered in soft iridescent shades of pale blue and white, appearing to float gently in the sky. A faint, shimmering trail of stardust curves in a heart shape behind the feather, adding a magical touch. The overall atmosphere is serene and whimsical, providing a peaceful closure to the visual narrative. The design is flat and 2D, with full-bleed background. The bottom-right corner area is intentionally left clear for a QR code, with decorative elements concentrated towards the center and left. No text or people are present.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a dreamy fantasy anime style. The composition features a clear glass bottle filled with a whimsical, enchanting scene. Inside the bottle, stylized, glowing bell-shaped flowers with delicate green vines are arranged around a cluster of pastel-colored, kawaii mushrooms. One mushroom, in particular, has a friendly, simple face. The bottle itself is rendered with soft, translucent edges. Surrounding the bottle, the background is a soft lavender sky filled with a scattering of delicate white sparkles and star-like glints. A swirling, ethereal ribbon of soft pastel colorsâ€”peach, pink, and pale orangeâ€”trails across the right side of the background, also speckled with tiny stars. A faceted, translucent crystal rests on the lavender ground to the right of the bottle. The overall color palette is soft and pastel, dominated by lavenders, peaches, soft pinks, and pale greens, creating a magical and serene atmosphere. The artistic style is flat 2D artwork, with soft, painterly textures and a gentle, diffused lighting effect that enhances the dreamy, enchanting quality.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a dreamy, celestial aesthetic. The background is a soft gradient of lavender and pale violet, densely speckled with tiny, sparkling white stars and ethereal, swirling nebulae that extend to the edges of the full-bleed image. The message is presented in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script in a dark, rich ink. The text is artistically arranged to fill the central area of the card, gracefully avoiding the top and bottom 10% for printing safety. Decorative elements are minimal but impactful, framing the text with whimsical, stylized celestial motifs. On the left side, a swirling, stardust-filled path curves upwards, culminating in a delicate, line-drawn teacup and saucer perched on a crescent moon. On the upper right, a charming, simplified line-drawing of a whimsical bird, possibly a phoenix or celestial chicken, is depicted in flight. These decorative elements are rendered in a delicate, luminous white, complementing the starry background and enhancing the dreamy, magical atmosphere. The overall design prioritizes clear readability of the message while evoking a sense of wonder and cosmic friendship, with a quirky, unconventional artistic flair. The style is reminiscent of a dreamy fantasy anime aesthetic, with a magical atmosphere and detailed, enchanting fairy-tale qualities."
