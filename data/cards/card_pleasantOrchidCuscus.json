In the background, hints of an adventure unfold: a soft-focus mountain range under a warm, golden-hour sky, a small, cozy-looking travel van parked near a gentle stream, and a partially visible, illustrated world map with a red heart marking a special location. The colors are soft, saturated, and luminous, with gentle bleeds and delicate ink linework, giving everything a handmade, storybook quality that feels both nostalgic and full of life. The overall effect is one of pure, heartfelt gratitude, celebrating friendship, adventure, and the wonderful, unexpected joys (like a sweet dog) found along the way.\n\n2.

The background is a deep twilight blue, resembling a night sky filled with subtle constellations. Overlaid on the sky is a faint, ethereal outline of the world map, with continents and country borders subtly defined by thin lines of light. In the upper center, a glowing, golden Shiba Inu dog, depicted in a cute, simplified cartoon style, is positioned as if floating. A luminous, golden string connects the dog to the center of the image. Below the dog and the world map, a pair of silhouetted figures, representing a couple with arms around each other, are sitting on a gentle, dark hill. The primary text, \\\"Thank You\\\", is prominently displayed in a beautiful, flowing, golden handwritten cursive font, centered in the image, with the golden string from the dog subtly curving around it. The overall mood is heartwarming, inspirational, and magical, evoking a sense of gratitude, adventure, and connection.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, continuing the stylized, dreamy illustration style.

The world map outline from the front cover is subtly present, less defined and with fewer constellation lines, creating a sense of fading wonder. In the center-left area, a delicate, shimmering gold constellation, perhaps shaped like a playful dog's paw print or a subtle representation of adventure (like a simplified compass rose), is the main decorative element. The bottom-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square, is completely clear and undecorated, reserved for a QR code.

Soft, ethereal mountains are visible in the distant background under a warm, golden-hour sky that transitions into the twilight blue.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist and elegant style. The background is a deep, dark navy blue. A single, continuous, thin golden line forms an intricate, interlocked heart shape in the upper left quadrant of the image. Inside the heart, a small, glowing golden paw print is subtly placed. The golden line extends from the bottom of the heart and curves gently downwards and towards the right, trailing off into the dark background. The overall aesthetic is serene, sophisticated, and symbolic, subtly referencing the theme of pets and love without being overly explicit. There is no text or QR code visible on this back cover, and the design is clean and uncluttered, offering a sense of peaceful resolution to the card's visual narrative.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a visually cohesive and storytelling artistic style inspired by intricate papercraft and ancient cartography. The background is composed of folded, stylized topographic maps rendered in shades of deep indigo blue and antique gold. These map-mountains create a sense of depth and adventure. Flowing through the center of the composition is a winding, glowing golden path, imbued with a soft, ethereal light, leading the eye downwards. Along this path, four luminous paw prints are embedded, each glowing with the same warm, inviting light, symbolizing a journey and the joy of discovery, directly referencing the \"Sushi\" element. The overall aesthetic is that of a meticulously crafted, subtly textured illustration, with a delicate, almost woven appearance to the map elements. The colors are rich yet muted, creating an inspirational and sophisticated mood. The composition is dynamic, with the winding path and surrounding map-mountains creating a sense of movement and exploration. No text is present on this page, allowing the artwork to fully convey the developing narrative. The artistic technique suggests a combination of digital illustration with subtle texturing and lighting effects, reminiscent of detailed book illustrations or stylized graphic art.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with elegant, flowing golden-yellow foliage elements framing the text. The background is a deep, textured navy blue with subtle, scattered white and golden specks resembling a starry night sky. The foliage starts from the bottom left corner, with a delicate vine that curves upwards and inwards, featuring stylized leaves and small, glowing star-like accents. This vine extends towards the upper left corner, creating an open, airy space for the handwritten message in the center. The handwritten message itself is in a warm, luminous golden-yellow cursive script, perfectly legible and gracefully styled, with natural variations in line weight suggesting a fine pen. The text includes the salutation \"Adriana,\" the main body of the message, and a closing \"With so much love, Ae.\" The overall style is sophisticated and slightly whimsical, with a glowing, ethereal quality to the foliage and text, conveying a heartfelt and inspirational tone. There are no other decorative elements except for a few small, scattered glowing stars that echo the foliage's starry accents. The composition prioritizes ample, clean space for the message, enhanced by the artistic framing."
