    "backCover": "A simple and elegant decorative design for the back of a greeting card, bringing a peaceful conclusion to the visual story. On a soft, solid teal background that matches the front cover's palette, a single, stylized golden winding key, reminiscent of the wind-up toy theme, is illustrated in the upper-left quadrant. It has a graceful, almost calligraphic quality. The design is minimal and serene, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear and undecorated. The overall style is flat 2D, with consistent warm lighting and a sophisticated, whimsical feel.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front in a flat 2D art style. Three stylized cartoon characters, inspired by the reference, are depicted as vintage wind-up toys on a polished wooden floor. One character is mid-wobble, another is comically stiff-legged, and the third is leaning precariously. Tiny gears and springs are subtly scattered around their feet. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The scene is lit with warm, bright light, and the color palette features cheerful tones of teal, sunny yellow, and warm gray, creating a playful and whimsical atmosphere. The background is a simple, clean wall, keeping the focus on the characters. All key elements are kept away from the edges for safe printing.",
    "leftInterior": "A creative and innovative design for the left interior of a birthday card. A detailed, blueprint-style diagram of a fantastical, Rube Goldberg-esque 'Anti-Groan Machine' is drawn with white ink on a rich teal background. The diagram shows a whimsical contraption with silly components like rubber chickens, springs, pillows, and an oil can, all connected by an absurdly complex system of levers and pulleys. The labels and notes are written in a quirky, technical-style hand-drawn font, adding to the humorous, smart theme. The design is purely illustrative, containing no characters, and maintains the card's flat 2D art style and humorous tone.",
    "rightInterior": "The right interior of a humorous birthday card, featuring the message elegantly integrated into the artwork. On a clean, light cream background, the text is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script with a natural pen-ink flow. The message reads: 'Happy birthday! I was going to get you one of those cards that makes a sound, but I figured you hear enough creaking and groaning from your own joints already. Hope you have a fantastic day!'. The text is framed by delicate, whimsical illustrations of sound waves emanating from stylized 'creak' and 'groan' sound effects, which are artfully drawn as if part of a musical score. Tiny, subtle illustrations of gears and springs from the cover are woven into the decorative sound wave border. The color palette is consistent with the rest of the card, using teal and warm gray accents. All text and key art are centered, avoiding the edges for safe printing."
