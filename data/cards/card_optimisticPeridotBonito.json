    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a joyful, humorous, and heartwarming illustration in a vibrant, flat 2D cartoon style. The scene depicts a cozy kitchen setting bathed in warm, soft lighting. The primary focus is on a couple, a man with dark hair and a woman with blonde hair and a ponytail, embracing affectionately. They are both smiling broadly and waving, exuding happiness. The woman has a small, decorative mark on her forehead. The text \"Happy Anniversary, my other half!\" is prominently displayed above them in a playful, bubbly, orange-red font, enclosed in a soft, cloud-like speech bubble.\n\nThe foreground features a kitchen counter with whimsical, personified elements: a smiling, cheerful toaster, two anthropomorphic salt and pepper shakers holding hands and dancing, and a fork. There are also heart-shaped cookies or pastries floating near the toaster, adding a sweet touch. In the background, a stove with a pot on it and a window showing a hint of an exterior are visible, along with a mint green cabinet. To the right of the main couple, two other characters are present: an older man in a brown shirt and cap, looking slightly grumpy, and a woman in a peach-colored suit, smiling. A young boy with a worried expression is also in the background. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with dominant tones of yellow, orange, peach, and mint green, creating a cheerful and celebratory atmosphere. The composition is dynamic, with the main couple drawing the viewer's eye, and the surrounding elements adding to the narrative and humorous tone.",

The artwork is in a flat, 2D cartoon style with bold black outlines and a cheerful, limited color palette of pastel yellow, peach, and a soft green background. A winding path composed of large jigsaw puzzle pieces, colored in alternating pastel yellow and peach, dominates the center of the image, curving from the upper left to the lower right. This puzzle path is a visual metaphor for the journey of a long-term relationship. At the heart of the puzzle path, the large number \"20\" is seamlessly integrated into the puzzle pieces, signifying the 20-year milestone. A bright yellow tandem bicycle, designed for two riders with two seats, is parked on the puzzle path, symbolizing shared adventures and companionship. The background is a calming, pastel green, representing nature and a serene setting. Scattered across the green grass are playful, stylized flowers with happy, smiling faces, rendered in the same pastel peach and yellow as the puzzle pieces. Flanking the puzzle path are two adorable, plump cartoon squirrels, also in a cheerful green, with exaggerated happy expressions and open paws, as if clapping or cheering. The overall impression is one of joy, shared journey, and lighthearted celebration of a long-lasting love. The style is clean, simple, and evokes a sense of innocent fun.",

A simple bow shape made of these intertwined ribbons is positioned at the bottom center.
