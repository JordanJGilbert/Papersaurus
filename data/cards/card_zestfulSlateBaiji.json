    "frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous watercolor greeting card front. Illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are the central focus. They are seated at a low Japanese-style table, surrounded by a delightful chaos of tiny, happy cartoon dogs of various small breeds, all with party hats. Lao Lao, in her black shirt, is laughing joyfully as she tries to fend off a tiny puppy who is playfully attempting to steal a piece of salmon nigiri from her chopsticks. Jordan, in his maroon t-shirt, grins widely as he holds up a large sushi platter, offering it towards Lao Lao, while another small dog at his feet begs for a treat. The scene is filled with colorful, oversized watercolor sushi rolls\u2014tuna maki, california rolls, and shrimp tempura\u2014that are scattered around the floor like playful building blocks. The background is a soft wash of light teal and pink watercolor, with subtle ink splatters adding to the dynamic, cheerful feel. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable, dark-gray handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\". Flat 2D artwork, soft edges, lighthearted and funny composition.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean greeting card back cover. A single, elegant piece of salmon nigiri sushi, illustrated in a whimsical watercolor style, sits in the upper-left corner. The background is a full-bleed, soft wash of light teal watercolor with subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds, matching the front cover's aesthetic. The design is very sparse, with the bottom-right quadrant completely empty for a logo or QR code placement. Flat 2D artwork, soft flowing colors, professional polish."
