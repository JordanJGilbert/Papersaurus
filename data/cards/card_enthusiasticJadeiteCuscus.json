    "frontCover": "Front cover of a wedding greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a stylized cartoon illustration inspired by the provided reference. The artwork is in a warm, impressionistic watercolor painting style with soft, blurred edges and a sun-drenched color palette of warm peaches, soft golds, dusty rose, and sage green. Visible, delicate brushstrokes and beautiful color bleeds give the artwork an authentic, hand-painted feel.\n\nThe scene depicts two charming, simplified cartoon characters, a smiling man with brown curly hair and a woman with dark hair wearing sunglasses, holding hands. They stand on a wooden pier at dusk, with a serene body of water stretching out behind them. Above them, a stylized, glowing world map is depicted against a deep blue, starry night sky. The text \"Phillip & Sarah\" is written in elegant, legible cursive script in a light gold color, positioned centrally above the couple.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a wedding greeting card with a warm, impressionistic watercolor painting style. The background is a deep, moody blue watercolor wash, transitioning to a lighter, soft beige towards the bottom right. Scattered across the blue expanse are subtle, delicate gold flecks, resembling distant stars. In the upper left quadrant, a stylized golden eight-pointed star radiates a soft glow, mirroring celestial guidance. Positioned on the left side of the card, a vintage brass-finished compass with a detailed face showing directional letters (N, S, E, W) and a subtly glowing golden needle pointing northeast, is rendered with a realistic yet soft watercolor texture. The entire design evokes a sense of journey, adventure, and celestial blessing. There is ample clear space on the right side and towards the bottom for a QR code, with decorative elements primarily concentrated on the left and upper portions of the card. The artistic style is consistent with a dreamy, romantic scene with soft, blurred edges and a gentle, sun-drenched color palette of warm peaches, soft golds, dusty rose, and sage green if these elements were present in a front or interior. However, for this back cover, the color palette is focused on the deep blues and subtle golds, creating a serene and contemplative closure to the visual story. The overall mood is peaceful and aspirational, suggesting a new journey beginning under a guiding star.",

The entire image is rendered in a warm, impressionistic watercolor painting style, with visible, delicate brushstrokes and beautiful color bleeds that give the artwork an authentic, hand-painted feel. The color palette is dominated by the deep blue and golden yellow, with subtle hints of warmer tones within the dandelion's glow, creating a dreamy, romantic, and heartfelt atmosphere. This visual complements the theme of wishing well and looking forward to future adventures, with the dandelion's scattered seeds symbolizing new beginnings and the stars representing guidance and good luck on the couple's journey. The composition is clean and balanced, focusing on the symbolic imagery without any text or characters.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a wedding card designed for message space with a dark navy textured background. The central focus is the heartfelt message, \"Phillip & Sarah, Watching you two getting married has been such a sweet thing, and I am so grateful for all the fun and positive energy you've brought into my life. I'm wishing you a lifetime of happiness on this beautiful journey. I‚Äôm looking forward to keeping in touch, wherever your adventure takes you. With all my love, Jerry\", rendered in an elegant, flowing, golden-yellow cursive script. This script is not perfectly uniform, but possesses natural character, warmth, and a sophisticated, legible pen-style appearance with subtle variations in line weight, evoking a genuine, heartfelt tone. Framing the message, particularly on the left and right sides and subtly curving towards the top, are delicate, luminous swirls of golden glitter and light. These abstract, ethereal flourishes are reminiscent of sparkling dust or ephemeral trails of light, adding a touch of magic and sophistication without being overtly floral or pictorial. The overall style is flat 2D artwork, with the dark navy background extending to the edges, and the golden decorative elements providing a striking contrast to the deep hue. The composition ensures all text and decorative elements are positioned well within the safe printing margins, with a particular emphasis on creating a visually appealing and uncluttered space for the message. The artistic style is consistent with a warm, impressionistic feel, emphasizing soft light and delicate textures."
