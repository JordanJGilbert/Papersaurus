Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"graduation\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm, painterly watercolor style, featuring the iconic Sather Tower at UC Berkeley bathed in the golden light of a setting sun. The sky is a blend of soft oranges, pinks, and Berkeley blues, with gentle, bleeding colors creating a dreamy, celebratory atmosphere. The surrounding trees and Campanile Esplanade are rendered with loose, expressive brushstrokes, suggesting life and movement. The entire scene feels handcrafted and personal, capturing a beautiful, fleeting moment of accomplishment and nostalgia, as if painted from a cherished memory.\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity.

The artwork features two stylized, animated characters, a young woman with dark hair and glasses and a young man in a graduation gown and cap, both looking surprised and running. Behind them, a grand, classical-style building with a green roof and arched windows is depicted. The sky is a bright blue with stylized white clouds. Several graduation caps with tassels are tossed into the air, with three anthropomorphic squirrels wearing miniature graduation caps also in the air, looking excited. The text \"CONGRATS ON GRADUATING BERKELEY!\" is prominently displayed in bold, black, sans-serif lettering, with \"BERKELEY!\" being the largest. The color palette is vibrant, with a strong emphasis on blues for the sky and academic regalia, greens for the building and grass, and warm browns for the squirrels and characters' hair.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a graduation greeting card with a flat, 2D cartoon illustration in a \"Smart Style\" that complements the front cover's humorous and lighthearted tone. The scene features two adorable, stylized cartoon squirrels wearing graduation caps, sitting on a tree branch against a soft, hazy background of a university building and a pale blue sky with fluffy clouds. Scattered on the branch are small, confetti-like rectangles in blue and yellow, mirroring the celebratory theme. The art style is reminiscent of textured paper or a lightly stippled effect, creating a warm and inviting feel. The colors are predominantly warm oranges, browns, blues, and greens, consistent with the front cover's palette. The composition is clean and simple, with the main focus on the charming squirrels. There is no text visible on the back cover, and the design elements are placed with ample clearance from the edges, particularly leaving the bottom right corner entirely free, suggesting it's reserved for a QR code. This design provides a sweet and gentle conclusion to the visual narrative, reinforcing the celebratory and whimsical graduation theme without introducing new characters or complex elements.",

Large, simplified green leaves frame the top of the scene. The overall art style is flat, 2D, with a subtle textured grain, and a bright, cheerful color palette. The tone is humorous and lighthearted, with the squirrels depicted in a friendly, charming manner. The composition places the main subjects centrally on the branch, with ample space around them to create a visually pleasing and uncluttered feel.",
