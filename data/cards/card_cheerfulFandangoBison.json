    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a cartoon-style, somewhat distressed robot. The robot is primarily gray with orange accents on its ears, hands, and shoulder joints. It has large, wide, black-and-white eyes conveying surprise or worry, and a downward-curving mouth. Yellow zigzag lines emanating from its head and orange \"spark\" shapes near its chest indicate electrical malfunction or stress. From its chest, a cluster of brightly colored, wavy streamers in teal, green, orange, and red spills out. Two rectangular digital display panels are attached to the robot's chest, each displaying the text \"Happy Birthday!\" in a clean, sans-serif font. The composition is centered on the robot, with the background a plain, off-white color. The overall mood is quirky and humorous, with a touch of endearing vulnerability. The art style has a slight textured, painterly quality, suggestive of digital painting.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a \"happy birthday\" greeting card with a minimalist, playful aesthetic, featuring a clean, off-white background with a subtle textured border in a light beige. The composition is asymmetrical and sparsely populated, drawing inspiration from the front of the card's presumed simple, character-driven design. Positioned in the lower left quadrant of the card, a cluster of five colorful, flat, rectangular building blocks are arranged in a staggered, overlapping hashtag shape. The colors of the blocks are bright and primary: red, yellow, green, blue, and orange. To the right of the blocks, and slightly higher, is a single, large, googly eye. The eye has a white sclera, a black pupil, and a light blue iris with subtle gray shading to suggest depth and a reflective highlight. The eye appears to be looking slightly to the left, towards the building blocks. The overall effect is charming and whimsical, creating a sense of curiosity and interaction between the elements. There is ample negative space on the upper two-thirds of the card, leaving room for potential branding or a QR code in the upper right quadrant, though none is explicitly shown. The simple, graphic elements provide a lighthearted and memorable closing to the card's visual narrative.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a detailed, intricate illustration of tangled wires and electronic components in a dark, moody, and slightly dystopian style. The artistic style is flat design with subtle gradients and a focus on clean, geometric shapes. The color palette is dominated by deep teal and vibrant orange for the wires and highlights, set against a dark charcoal background. Scattered throughout the composition are various dark gray, rounded rectangular modules with glowing dots in teal or orange, resembling status indicators or input/output ports. Several prominent orange triangular warning signs are visible, one containing the number \"404\" in orange text. Another module features a sad blue emoji face. Smaller teal and orange dots act as accent lights. The wires are depicted with a soft glow and a sense of depth, creating a chaotic yet organized network. The overall layout is dense and visually complex, with the wires weaving across the entire page, creating a sense of interconnectedness and perhaps a subtle commentary on technological complexity. There is no explicit text other than the \"404\" and the exclamation point within a warning triangle. The composition is dynamic and engaging, with the bright orange elements providing strong focal points within the darker, more muted background.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a large, rounded speech bubble outline in teal, containing placeholder text. Above the speech bubble, a pixelated orange heart icon sits to the right of a horizontal progress bar graphic with an orange fill indicating 99% and a thin teal outline. The background of the card is a very light, creamy off-white. The main body of the speech bubble is white, providing ample blank space for a handwritten message. The text within the bubble uses a clean, sans-serif font in a dark teal color, with \"Happy birthday!\" in a larger, bolder weight at the top. Below the speech bubble, two stylized starburst or snowflake-like graphics are present, one larger on the left in teal and one smaller on the right in a darker teal. The overall style is clean, modern, and slightly playful with graphic elements and a limited, cohesive color palette of creamy off-white, teal, and orange."
