FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the formal and business-appropriate tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"thank-you\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs!

This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a thank-you card with formal and business-appropriate tone.

HANDWRITING STYLE: Write the message in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. The handwriting should be legible, flowing, and have natural character - not overly perfect but graceful and warm. Use a nice pen-style appearance with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight. Think of sophisticated calligraphy that's still approachable and easy to read. Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters. This should feel like the emotional peak of the card experience, harmonizing with the left interior as a cohesive spread. Avoid clichÃ© designs and create something genuinely special! Use the elegant cursive handwriting style described above. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n4. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\nVISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:\n- Same color palette across all sections\n- Consistent lighting/time of day\n- Same artistic techniques and brushwork\n- Recurring visual motifs or symbols (but make them unique and memorable!)\n- Progressive emotional journey from introduction to resolution\n- Front cover: stylized cartoon/illustrated characters if people are needed for the theme\n- Left interior: CREATIVE FREEDOM but NO PEOPLE unless user specifically requested people in their description\n- Right interior: focus on message space with innovative decorative elements (NO PEOPLE)\n- Back cover: simple yet creative decorative design without text or people\n- Use simplified, friendly, charming character design if including people (front cover only)\n- CREATIVITY PRIORITY: Always choose the more innovative, surprising, and memorable option over generic designs\n\nReturn JSON:\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"detailed prompt with story opening elements\",\n  \"backCover\": \"detailed prompt with story conclusion elements\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"detailed prompt with story development elements\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"detailed prompt with story climax elements\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Create a completely unique and different interpretation for this specific card variant.

    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The scene depicts a stylized, grey, long-necked dinosaur wearing glasses, sitting on a raised platform facing an audience. The dinosaur's head is turned slightly to the right. Behind the dinosaur, on a light-colored wall, is a diagram of interconnected nodes, rendered in soft yellow. The words \\\"Thank You\\\" are prominently displayed in a elegant, golden, handwritten cursive script, positioned in the upper left to center area of the card, safely away from the edges. The audience is represented by blurred, silhouetted figures in shades of blue and grey, creating a sense of depth and focus on the speaker. The overall color palette consists of muted earthy tones, soft blues, greys, and hints of gold, with visible watercolor textures and paper grain. The mood is sophisticated and slightly whimsical, fitting a professional yet warm tone.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The design features a subtle continuation of the visual theme from the front cover. A faint, abstract representation of the interconnected node diagram from the front is visible in the upper center, rendered in soft, pale yellow watercolor washes. The overall background is a gentle gradient of muted beige and grey, with subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds. The design is minimal and serene, focusing on atmospheric washes and delicate linework. The bottom-right corner is left completely clear and undecorated for a QR code. The mood is peaceful and artistic, providing a gentle conclusion to the card's narrative.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. This page continues the visual narrative with a focus on the \\\"AI for Good\\\" theme and the dinosaur character. The scene shows the same stylized, grey, long-necked dinosaur wearing glasses, now depicted in a more dynamic pose, perhaps gesturing with a forelimb or looking thoughtfully towards a representation of the \\\"AI for Good\\\" concept. This could be visualized as abstract glowing particles, interconnected data streams, or a stylized futuristic city skyline rendered in soft watercolor. The background maintains the muted earthy and blue-grey color palette, with subtle textures and paint bleeds. The overall composition is elegant and professional, subtly referencing the front cover's elements without being repetitive. No text is present on this page, allowing the visual story to develop.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. This page features the main message, presented in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script in a warm, golden-brown ink that resembles a fine pen. The text reads: \\\"Dear papersaurus, Thank you for your valuable participation and insightful contributions at the AI for Good summit. Your presence made a significant impact, and it was a pleasure to connect with you. We look forward to future collaborations. Sincerely, happyverse\\\". The handwriting is elegant, flowing, and has natural character. The message is integrated into an innovative decorative artwork that frames it. This artwork subtly incorporates elements from the front cover, such as a simplified version of the interconnected node diagram in soft yellow washes, or abstract watercolor washes in the established palette of muted earthy tones and soft blues/greys. The design is sophisticated and visually engaging, avoiding clichÃ©s and creating a unique artistic composition that complements the message. The tone remains formal and business-appropriate, with a touch of warmth.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a thank you greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The background features soft, muted grey watercolor washes that transition into a creamy off-white at the bottom right. A delicate, abstract golden geometric pattern, reminiscent of a stylized circuit board or network of connections, is subtly present in the upper left corner. This pattern consists of thin, interconnected golden lines with small, circular golden nodes at their intersections and ends. The overall impression is sophisticated, serene, and minimalist. There is no text or discernible image in the provided back cover image. A blank space is intentionally left in the bottom-right corner, roughly a 1-inch square, to accommodate a QR code. The design provides a sense of quiet closure, echoing the technological or network theme with its subtle golden accents against the watercolor texture, while maintaining a professional and elegant aesthetic. The watercolor texture and color palette are consistent with the rest of the imagined card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style, featuring a central, stylized golden branching structure against a textured, deep blue watercolor background. The branches are thin and delicate, extending upwards and outwards, reminiscent of a natural, organic form. Scattered along the branches are small, geometric, faceted crystal-like elements that are translucent white with subtle highlights. The watercolor technique is evident through soft color transitions, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, particularly in the background where the blue deepens and lightens. The overall impression is sophisticated, minimalist, and slightly ethereal, with a focus on clean lines and subtle details, maintaining a professional and formal tone. The composition is balanced, drawing the eye upwards through the branching motif.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a professional, formal, and business-appropriate tone. The artwork is in a watercolor painting style with soft, flowing colors in shades of warm yellow, cream, and muted blue, exhibiting paper texture and organic paint bleeds. Prominently featured is the handwritten message: \"Dear papersaurus, Thank you for your valuable participation and insightful contributions at the AI for Good summit. Your presence made a significant impact, and it was a pleasure to connect with you. We look forward to future collaborations. Sincerely, happyverse\". The handwriting is in a beautiful, clearly readable cursive script, with a warm, natural, and flowing character, resembling elegant calligraphy with subtle ink variations. The message is centrally placed, creating a focal point for the text. Framing the message and extending from the bottom right corner and subtly into the top left corner are decorative elements resembling golden, abstract geometric molecular structures or network diagrams, rendered with a luminous, glowing effect. These geometric designs are integrated with delicate, thin, white brush strokes that mimic light trails or fine pen strokes, adding a touch of sophistication and a subtle connection to technology or abstract thought. The overall composition is clean, avoiding people or overly ornate floral elements, and creates a harmonious blend of artistic expression and functional message space, aligning with a formal yet welcoming aesthetic."
