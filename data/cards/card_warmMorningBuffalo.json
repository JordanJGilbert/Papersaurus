Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme.

Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs!

The sky is a soft blend of orange, pink, and pale blue, with gentle clouds catching the last light of the day. The golf carts, rendered with loose, painterly brushstrokes, are parked near a majestic old oak tree on a gentle hill overlooking a manicured green. The colors are rich and invitingâ€”lush greens, earthy browns, and the warm glow of the sunâ€”creating a feeling of peace, joy, and a day well-spent.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a vibrant, stylized illustration. The art style is flat 2D with bold outlines and a retro feel. The color palette consists of warm oranges, yellows, greens, and blues, with pops of dark blue for text and outlines. The scene depicts a golf course under a bright orange sky with a setting sun. In the foreground, two anthropomorphic foxes are driving golf carts. The fox on the left, in an orange golf cart, has a surprised expression and is wearing a blue shirt. The fox on the right, in a teal golf cart, is pointing forward with a cheerful expression and is also wearing a blue shirt. Both golf carts have whimsical, large circular headlights. The golf carts are driving on a green grassy slope, with decorative elements like scattered colorful dots resembling confetti or sprinkles on the ground. A checkered flag flies from a pole on the orange golf cart. The background features rolling hills with a stylized, almost abstract checkered pattern on some of them, and quirky, stylized trees with swirling branches. The text \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAVID!\" is prominently displayed at the top in a bold, dark blue, slightly playful sans-serif font. The overall mood is humorous, energetic, and festive.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card, featuring a continuation of the stylized, flat 2D cartoon golf theme with a touch of whimsical charm. The overall artistic style is consistent with a smooth, simplified illustration aesthetic. The background depicts a serene night sky in gradients of deep purple and indigo, transitioning to a lighter shade towards the horizon. A large, pale yellow full moon, subtly textured like a golf ball, dominates the upper portion of the image. A few small, stylized stars are scattered across the sky. In the middle ground, silhouetted, rounded trees are arranged in clusters, adding depth to the landscape. The foreground shows a simplified golf course fairway, rendered with a subtle green checkered pattern and a muted blue-green hue. Scattered on the fairway are a few colorful, abstract confetti-like shapes in shades of purple and orange, hinting at a celebration. There are no characters or text present on this back cover, adhering to the requirement for a peaceful, decorative resolution. The composition focuses on the expansive night sky and the iconic golf ball moon, creating a sense of calm and closure while subtly referencing the golf theme. The bottom portion of the back cover has a smooth, pale peach-colored area, designed to be a clean, unobtrusive space, potentially for a QR code or mailing label, with decorative elements concentrated in the upper and middle areas of the card to ensure ample clear space.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a flat, 2D graphic illustration in a modern, stylized, and humorous art style. The scene depicts a bright, sunny day on a golf course. The background features rolling green hills with a few simplified, dark green trees. The sky is a vibrant, clear blue with a stylized, bright yellow sun in the upper right corner, emitting thin yellow rays. Two stylized, fluffy white clouds are present in the sky. In the foreground, a large, three-tiered birthday cake is prominently displayed. The cake has layers of pastel pink, light blue, and white frosting, adorned with colorful sprinkles. A single, tall birthday candle with a flickering orange flame sits atop the cake, positioned as if it were a flag on a golf hole. To the left of the cake, a yellow golf cart is depicted at a precarious angle, with its front wheels resting on the top tier of the cake, as if it has driven onto it. The golf cart is simplified in design, with black wheels and black accents. Small, curved black lines are illustrated around the golf cart's rear wheels, suggesting motion or impact. The overall color palette is cheerful and bold, with a strong emphasis on primary and pastel colors. The composition is playful and unexpected, creating a humorous visual narrative for a birthday celebration. The artwork is full-bleed, extending to all edges of the page, with a 9:16 aspect ratio.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a festive, lighthearted golf theme. The background is a soft, pale yellow. The page features a decorative border composed of repeating elements on the left and right sides. This border consists of stylized green and golden yellow ribbons or streamers, interspersed with small, circular green golf balls that have subtle dimple detailing. Scattered confetti, depicted as small green and yellow dots, also accentuates the border. The lower portion of the page prominently displays two cheerful, stylized cartoon foxes giving each other a high-five, rendered in warm orange and cream colors with expressive smiles. The foxes are positioned to the left, leaving the majority of the page open for a handwritten message. The overall aesthetic is playful and celebratory, with a simple, flat 2D illustration style."
