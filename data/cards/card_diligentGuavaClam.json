    "frontCover": "[dbe66375-bfbc-43fd-9004-7bbd3e7ee207] A whimsical and humorous birthday card in a charming flat 2D watercolor style. The scene depicts a chaotic and funny \"birthday parade\" led by a cheerful, illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo, wearing her blue sweatshirt. She is joyfully marching across the bottom of the card. Following her in a comically long line is an illustrated Jordan from the photo, wearing his brown hoodie, looking slightly overwhelmed but smiling as he tries to wrangle five adorable and rambunctious corgis on leashes. The corgis are all in various states of excitement: one is trying to chase its tail, another is jumping up trying to lick Jordan's face, one is pulling forward eagerly, another is sniffing the ground, and the last one is looking back with a playful \"yapping\" expression. The entire scene is set against a clean, soft white background with delicate watercolor splatters of pastel pink, yellow, and blue, giving it a celebratory feel. Centered above the scene in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\". The overall artwork has soft edges and a light, airy feel, emphasizing the funny and lighthearted tone.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean back cover for a greeting card in a flat 2D watercolor style. The entire background is a soft, clean white with a subtle paper texture. In the top-left corner, there is a very small, delicate cluster of abstract watercolor splatters in pastel pink, yellow, and soft blue, with organic paint bleeds. The design is extremely minimal, occupying only the top corner, leaving the rest of the space, especially the bottom-right, completely empty. The artwork has soft edges and a light, airy feel.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and subtle decorative panel for the inside of a greeting card, created in a flat 2D watercolor style. A gentle, artistic wash of blended pastel pink, yellow, and soft blue watercolor paint flows gracefully down the left side of the panel, covering about one-third of the area. The colors blend softly into each other with visible artistic brush strokes and organic paint bleeds, fading gently into the clean white background that covers the rest of the panel. The overall effect is light, airy, and purely decorative, with no text or central figures.",
    "rightInterior": "A tastefully designed panel for a personal message, in a flat 2D watercolor style. The background is a clean, soft white with a visible paper texture. A single, elegant, dark teal watercolor brushstroke sweeps horizontally across the top of the panel, about 15% down from the edge, creating a simple header. A few delicate, tiny splatters of pastel pink and yellow are scattered very lightly near the bottom corners, anchoring the design. The majority of the panel is left clean and open, providing ample, elegant space for a handwritten message.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my dearest Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to get you a pogo stick to celebrate, but then I realized with legs like yours, you could probably just hop to the moon and back on your own. Thanks for always being a step above the rest and for walking into my life.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
