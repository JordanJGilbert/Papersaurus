    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a warm, inviting, and artistic atmosphere, rendered in a Ghibli-inspired style. The scene depicts a cozy artist's nook nestled within a hollowed-out, ancient tree. Sunlight streams through organic, window-like openings in the tree's trunk, illuminating the space and casting dappled shadows. The background outside the tree reveals a lush, green forest with a winding path and a gentle stream, bathed in soft, golden light.\n\nFloating in the upper half of the image are three open art books, each displaying charming, hand-drawn illustrations of natural elements: one shows a stylized tree and a leafy vegetable, another features a pumpkin and a strawberry, and the third displays various fruits. These books appear to be magically suspended, hinting at the whimsical and imaginative nature of the artist.\n\nOn a rustic wooden shelf, several glass jars filled with glowing, colorful liquids (teal, amber, and blue) sit in a row, suggesting art supplies or magical concoctions. Below the shelf, a wooden workbench is set up with art supplies. A pot filled with a bundle of paintbrushes rests on the workbench. Several canvases are propped up, some on easels, showcasing serene landscape paintings with soft skies and rolling hills, reflecting the view outside. The overall color palette is dominated by warm earth tones, vibrant greens, and soft blues, creating a harmonious and inspiring visual experience. The artwork is flat 2D, designed for printing with full-bleed backgrounds. The style is painterly with visible brushstrokes, evoking a sense of handcrafted artistry. The emotional tone is deeply heartfelt and appreciative, celebrating creativity and natural beauty.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a warm, textured parchment scroll at the center. The scroll is unfurled, ready to receive handwritten text, and appears to be lightly shaded to give it a tactile, slightly aged feel. The message itself, \"Dearest Mau, Watching you paint the world with your beautiful spirit is the greatest gift, and today, we celebrate the incredible artist and person you are. Your life is a masterpiece, and I feel so lucky to have a place in the gallery of your heart. I hope your special day is as full and wonderful as the feast we're about to enjoy! All my love, Meiling,\" is presented in an elegant, flowing cursive handwriting style, rendered in a deep teal ink. The handwriting is perfectly legible, with a natural ink flow and subtle variations in line weight that suggest a brush pen or a high-quality calligraphy pen. This message is integrated harmoniously within the scroll. Encircling the scroll on both the left and right sides are vibrant, curving ribbons of color, reminiscent of paint strokes or swirling arcs of light, in shades of deep blue, turquoise, vibrant yellow, orange, and fuchsia. These colorful elements create a dynamic, artistic border that frames the message without overpowering it. The background is a soft, blended wash of peach and muted orange, suggesting a gentle, artistic sky or canvas. The overall artistic style is reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's whimsical yet grounded aesthetic, with a focus on warm, naturalistic colors and a slightly textured, painterly feel. The composition ensures ample, clear space for the handwritten message, with the decorative elements artfully placed to enhance rather than obscure the core content, all within a 9:16 aspect ratio."
