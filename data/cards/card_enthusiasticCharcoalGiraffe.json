FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a whimsical and heartwarming watercolor illustration style, featuring a charming, anthropomorphic animal, perhaps a joyful fox or a friendly bear, gleefully riding a vintage bicycle with a basket overflowing with vibrant, hand-painted wildflowers.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D illustration in a cheerful, cartoonish style. The background is a solid, light cream color. At the top, bold, rounded sans-serif text reads \"Happy Birthday\" in a vibrant, warm orange color with a slight texture suggesting a chalk or crayon effect. Below the text, centered, is a red paper bag, depicted with a simplified geometric style and a thick black outline. Inside the bag, a single, large french fry character is enthusiastically popping out. This character is yellow-orange, with a rectangular body, large, round, black and white eyes that are wide and convey excitement, and a big, open, smiling mouth. It has thin black stick arms flailing joyfully in the air. On the front of the paper bag, there is a large, bright orange circle, also with a thin black outline, adding a simple graphic element. The overall mood is lighthearted, humorous, and celebratory.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a minimalist, humorous, and heartwarming illustration. The artwork features a stylized, slightly tilted brown paper bag, reminiscent of a fast-food takeout bag, positioned in the lower half of the frame. A few scattered, bright yellow dots and tiny white specks are visible on the pale beige, subtly textured background near the opening of the bag, suggesting spilled crumbs or a hint of a tasty treat. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, relying on muted earth tones for the bag and a soft, creamy backdrop. The art style is clean, flat 2D vector art with subtle shading that gives a hint of volume without being 3D. There are no visible text elements, and the design leaves ample empty space towards the top and right of the card, which would be suitable for a QR code in the bottom-right corner without being explicitly shown. The design serves as a subtle nod to the message of finding a forgotten fry, offering a quiet, playful conclusion to the card's visual narrative.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a whimsical and lighthearted tone, in a flat 2D illustration style. The background is a pale, creamy yellow, reminiscent of a light custard or butter. The page is densely populated with a repeating pattern of stylized, golden-yellow french fries. These fries are depicted in a simple, slightly chunky rectangular shape with rounded ends, outlined with a bold, dark charcoal line that gives them a hand-drawn, slightly imperfect quality. The fries are scattered across the entire page at various angles and orientations, creating a dynamic yet playful visual. Many of the fries appear to be standard, while a few strategically placed fries have simple, cute cartoon faces drawn on them. One prominent fry in the center-right of the image has a smiling face with two dots for eyes and a curved line for a mouth. Another fry towards the bottom right has a similar smiling face, with one eye slightly closed as if winking. The overall effect is cheerful, humorous, and directly references the \"forgotten fry at the bottom of the bag\" sentiment from the card's message. The art style is clean, with a matte finish, emphasizing the graphic nature of the design.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space, featuring a warm, creamy off-white background. The text of the message, \"Jordan, Happy birthday! I hope your day is as happy as you are when you find a forgotten fry at the bottom of the bag. May your cake be sweet and your gifts be plentiful (and not require assembly). All the best, Alex\" is written in a rich, dark reddish-brown, elegant, and flowing cursive script. The typography is perfectly legible, with a natural variation in line weight that suggests a quality pen. The entire message is framed by a thick, continuous, slightly glossy, deep red border. This border has a unique, organic, hand-drawn quality, reminiscent of piped icing or a rich sauce, with a slightly irregular curve that gently encloses the text without being a strict geometric shape. The border starts at the top left, curves inwards to create an open top, flows down the left side, loops playfully at the bottom left, and then extends across the bottom, culminating in a dollop shape at the bottom right, resembling a blob of frosting or sauce. The overall aesthetic is clean, with the focus squarely on the heartfelt message and the playful, stylized border. There are no other decorative elements, patterns, or imagery present, ensuring the message remains the primary focus. The style is flat 2D artwork, suitable for printing."
