  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing birthday greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\nðŸŽ¨ CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clichÃ© designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"birthday card with cats\"\nStyle: âœ¨ Smart Style\nTone: ðŸ˜„ Funny - humorous and lighthearted\nTo: Jordan\nFrom: Jasmine\nMessage: \"Jordan,\n\nHappy birthday! I spent a long time brainstorming the perfect, thoughtful, age-appropriate gift for you. I considered sensible things like a nice pair of socks or perhaps a subscription to a magazine about responsible adulting.\n\nBut then I had a crucial realization: we're the same age. And if I'm being honest, I have absolutely no interest in receiving any of those things. I'd much rather have cake. And since we share a brain on most things, I figured you'd feel the same way.\n\nI did consult a second opinion, just to be sure. Your dog confirmed my suspicionsâ€”he wagged his tail twice, which is universal dog code for \"Just get the cake, human.\" So, my hands were tied. Let's get to the good stuff.\n\n- Jasmine\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages. If the user requests something potentially inappropriate, redirect to positive, wholesome alternatives that capture their intent in a family-friendly way\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1.

The cats have expressive, joyful faces, and one is wearing a tiny, lopsided party hat. A friendly, cartoonish golden retriever peeks in from the side of the frame, tail captured mid-wag with soft motion lines, giving a happy, knowing look. The artwork is rendered with soft, blended watercolor washes in a palette of warm ochres, gentle blues, and celebratory pinks, with delicate ink outlines that give the characters definition and personality without feeling rigid. The background is a simple, light wash of color, suggesting a cozy room, keeping the focus entirely on the sweet, celebratory moment between the friends. The entire illustration feels spontaneous, personal, and full of handcrafted love.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY!

Dominating the center is a sleek, black cat silhouette wearing thick, round, dark-rimmed glasses, giving it an intellectual and serious demeanor. The cat is holding a single, lit birthday candle in its paw, held aloft as if for illumination. In front of the cat, tilted slightly, is a piece of yellowed paper with the bold, dark text \\\"TOP SECRET\\\" at the top, underlined by a thin red line. Below that, in a smaller, sans-serif font, is the text \\\"The Perfect Gift\\\". The overall mood is humorous and intriguing, playing on the idea of a secret investigation for a gift. The lighting is dramatic, with the candle flame casting a warm glow on the cat's face and the \\\"TOP SECRET\\\" document, creating strong shadows and highlights. The text \\\"A Birthday Investigation\\\" is displayed prominently at the top in a classic serif font, cream-colored with a subtle shadow, completing the thematic presentation. The composition is tightly focused on the cat and the document, with no other elements present, emphasizing the 'investigation' theme.\"\n}",

The corkboard is covered in red string connecting various elements: a picture of a golden retriever dog with its tongue out and a red collar, a thought bubble above the dog containing a slice of birthday cake with a cherry, a small chart labeled \"FUN LEVELS\" with blue, green, and red bars, and a picture of a pair of socks with a red \"X\" through them. To the left of the dog's picture is another element showing a brain with a slice of cake inside, connected by an arrow to a cooked chicken. The overall color palette is warm and muted, with shades of beige for the corkboard and walls, and a warm brown for the floor. The linework is clean and bold with a slight cartoonish feel.
