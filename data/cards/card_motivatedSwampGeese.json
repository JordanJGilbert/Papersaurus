    "frontCover": "A whimsical and funny watercolor greeting card. A charming cartoon pig, wearing a jaunty little party hat slightly askew on its head, is gleefully leaping into a giant, messy chocolate birthday cake. Splatters of chocolate frosting and colorful sprinkles fly through the air in an artistic, joyful explosion. The pig has a look of pure, unadulterated bliss on its face. The background is a soft wash of pastel watercolor, with confetti gently floating down. The entire scene is painted in a vibrant, flowing watercolor style with soft edges and beautiful color bleeds. In the center, in a beautiful, readable, elegant cursive script, the words \"Go hog wild, it's your birthday!\" are written. Flat 2D artwork, perfect for printing.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card, in a beautiful watercolor painting style. The background is a soft wash of clean pastel colors, primarily creams and soft pinks, with a visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds. In the top-left corner, there is a small, artful cluster of watercolor chocolate splatters and colorful sprinkles, echoing the theme from the front cover. The design is very sparse, with the bottom-right corner intentionally left clean and empty for a logo or QR code. Flat 2D artwork for printing, full-bleed."
