    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a charming, stylized digital art illustration. The color palette is dominated by a deep, starry navy blue background, with pops of muted greens, browns, oranges, and off-white for the subjects and foreground elements. The main subjects are two men in a cartoonish, slightly simplified style. The man on the left is older, wearing a green jacket, a dark t-shirt, a baseball cap with an \"S\" logo, and glasses. He holds a white sign that reads \"HAROLD M.\". The man on the right is younger, with curly hair, wearing a dark blue t-shirt with \"ISLAND OF SICILIA\" and \"STARTX 2023\" written on a white sign he holds.\n\nIn the foreground, a laptop is open, with a stylized \"SUBMIT\" button on its screen emitting a fiery trail, suggesting an energetic or successful submission. The overall composition is centered, with the two men framing the laptop. Above them, the text \"StartX application\" is prominently displayed in a clean, modern sans-serif font, with \"StartX\" in a lighter, almost aquamarine color and \"application\" in a slightly darker shade of the same color. To the right of the text, a thin, upward-trending blue line graph is visible against the dark background, symbolizing growth or progress.\n\nThe mood is slightly humorous and hopeful, with a touch of an end-of-year celebration implied by the \"2023\" and the energetic submission. There are subtle decorative elements in the background, such as small, light blue star-like shapes scattered across the navy blue, adding to the atmospheric depth. The lines are clean and bold, with flat colors and subtle shading, characteristic of a modern illustration style.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a dark, starry night sky background. The overall artistic style is minimalist and modern, with a sci-fi or futuristic feel. The primary elements are a dark blue, 3D-rendered button labeled \"Submit\" with subtle white text, positioned in the upper left quadrant. Two flat, dark blue rectangular shapes extend from the sides of the button, resembling small solar panels or fins of a spacecraft. A thin, glowing turquoise-to-purple gradient line arcs from the bottom of the \"Submit\" button down towards the lower right quadrant. At the end of this line, a bright, luminous circular icon is depicted, containing a stylized, glowing atom or molecule symbol in white. The atom symbol itself has a soft, radiating glow with a color transition from turquoise to magenta. The composition is sparse, allowing the main elements to stand out against the vastness of the starry background, providing a sense of journey or connection. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code. The design provides closure by visually linking the action of submission (the button) to a successful outcome or destination (the glowing atom), completing the implied narrative of launching or sending something.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a vibrant, futuristic digital art style. The background is a deep, dark navy blue, reminiscent of a digital space or motherboard. Emanating from the bottom left corner and expanding outwards towards the top and right is an intricate network of glowing circuit board lines. These lines are rendered in bright, electric cyan and hot pink, with occasional thin magenta and deep indigo accents, creating a dynamic and energetic flow. Interspersed throughout the digital landscape are numerous scattered geometric shapes, primarily diamonds and small squares, in shades of pink, cyan, and a warm coral orange. These shapes appear to be bursting outwards or floating in a data stream, adding a sense of depth and motion. The overall composition is asymmetrical, with the detailed circuitry concentrated on the left and a more dispersed, explosive pattern of lines and shapes on the right, creating a compelling visual trajectory. The artistic style is flat and graphic, with sharp edges and clean lines, evoking a sense of modern technology and innovation. There is no visible text or typography on this page, allowing the visual design to dominate.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a deep navy blue background. The card features a decorative border of glowing electric blue circuit board traces with small, illuminated nodes scattered across the pattern. The circuit pattern is intricate and wraps around the edges, creating a visually striking, tech-themed frame. The central area is intentionally left mostly blank for handwritten messages, with the printed text \"Hey StartX,\" in elegant white script typography positioned at the top. The rest of the printed message follows in the same white script, filling the majority of the central space. The design balances the detailed, glowing circuit board decoration with ample open space, allowing for personalization."
