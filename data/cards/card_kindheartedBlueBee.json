    "frontCover": "A flat 2D comic book style birthday card front cover for John from Lauren. A charming, cartoon-style superhero, slightly paunchy with a silly grin and wearing a bright red cape, is depicted in a dynamic, mid-air pose as if just landing with a thud. He's surrounded by a classic comic book \"KAPOW!\" starburst effect. In a speech bubble above him, it humorously says, \"Don't worry, John! I've arrived to save you from another year of your youth!\" The background is a vibrant cityscape with halftone patterns. Centered in the middle of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The entire image has bold black outlines and a vibrant, energetic color palette typical of a vintage superhero comic.",
    "backCover": "A simple and clean back cover design in a flat 2D vintage comic book style. The background features a subtle, full-bleed vibrant blue sky with a soft halftone pattern, reminiscent of the front cover's cityscape background. In the upper-center, a small, stylized icon of the superhero's red cape is depicted, fluttering gently as if left behind. The design uses bold black outlines and the same vibrant, energetic color palette as the front cover, but in a more subdued and minimalist way. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1-inch square, is left completely blank and unadorned for QR code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed decorative art piece for the left interior of a greeting card, maintaining the vintage 2D comic book style. The design is an abstract composition of classic comic book sound effect graphics, like 'POW!', 'ZAP!', and 'WHAM!', arranged dynamically. The graphics overlap and are rendered in the same vibrant color palette (bright reds, yellows, blues) and bold black outlines as the front cover. The entire background is filled with a subtle gray halftone dot pattern, ensuring visual continuity. There are no characters or people, just a playful, energetic pattern of comic book iconography.",
    "rightInterior": "The right interior of the birthday card features a vibrant, full-bleed background of a light yellow with a subtle halftone pattern, consistent with the comic book theme. In the center of the card, the following message is written in a beautiful, elegant, and exceptionally clear handwritten cursive script: \"John,\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered I have to see you every day and I value my safety. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\n\nAll the best,\nLauren\". The text is rendered in a dark, contrasting ink for maximum legibility. The message is framed by decorative, comic-style starbursts and speed lines in the corners, using the same bright red and blue from the cover. These elements are positioned carefully to enhance the design without obscuring any part of the text, ensuring the heartfelt and humorous message is the clear focus."
