    "frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and humorous dreamscape celebrating Jordan's birthday. Illustrated in a vibrant, flat 2D art style with magical, ethereal qualities.\n\nAt the center, a cartoon version of Jordan (the man from the photo) sits triumphantly on a majestic flying sky bison, inspired by Appa from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The sky bison has a mischievous grin and is soaring through a dreamy pastel sky filled with soft, glowing clouds. Jordan has a joyful, celebratory expression, wearing a cozy black hoodie and holding a pair of giant chopsticks.\n\nHe is using the giant chopsticks to pluck elements from the scene around him. Instead of mountains, the landscape below is made of giant sushi rolls and nigiri pieces. A river of soy sauce flows gently between the sushi mountains. Jordan is attempting to pick up a huge dumbbell that has been cleverly disguised as a piece of salmon nigiri.\n\nFloating around the sky bison are glowing, ethereal lines of binary code (0s and 1s) that swirl like magical trails. To the left of the sky bison, a cartoon version of Lao Lao (the woman from the photo), wearing a black jacket and her glasses, is snowboarding down a steep \"snow-covered\" mountain that is actually a giant pile of sushi rice. She's laughing and pointing towards Jordan.\n\nIn the center of the card, nestled between the flying bison and the sushi landscape, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, colored in a soft, magical gold. The overall composition is dynamic, funny, and filled with personal details, creating a unique and personal fantasy world. The color palette is bright and dreamy, with soft pinks, blues, and purples in the sky, contrasting with the vibrant colors of the sushi.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean greeting card back cover. The design features a very light pastel pink background with subtle, glowing, ethereal lines of binary code (0s and 1s) faintly trailing in from the top-left corner and fading out towards the center. The style is flat 2D illustration, maintaining a magical and dreamy anime aesthetic. The design is sparse, occupying only the top-left quadrant, leaving the rest of the cover, especially the bottom-right corner, completely empty for branding or a QR code. The overall feel is soft, clean, and cohesive with a whimsical fantasy theme.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative greeting card left interior panel, designed in a flat 2D anime style. The artwork features a beautiful, serene landscape inspired by the front cover's theme. A gentle river of shimmering, dark soy sauce flows from the top left towards the bottom right. Along the bottom edge of the card, a border of vibrant, stylized sushi pieces\u2014like salmon nigiri and tuna maki\u2014is arranged like a peaceful, edible mountain range. The background is a dreamy pastel sky of soft blues and purples. The overall composition is subtle, artistic, and whimsical, serving as a beautiful, text-free decorative panel with no characters or figures.",
    "rightInterior": "A greeting card right interior panel designed to hold a personal message. The background is a very soft, pale sky blue with a hint of dreamy, glowing clouds, rendered in a flat 2D anime style. A single, elegant detail adorns the bottom-right corner: a small, artfully placed piece of salmon nigiri, subtly echoing the card's theme. This minimal decoration leaves the majority of the panel as a clean, open space, elegantly framed for a handwritten message. The design is light, airy, and focused on providing a beautiful backdrop for text, with no characters or figures included.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Hey Jordan,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to get you a huge gift, but I figured my long legs and tiny body already take up enough space in your life. You're welcome! Thanks for being the best boyfriend a girl could ask for.\n\nAll my love,\nLao Lao\""
