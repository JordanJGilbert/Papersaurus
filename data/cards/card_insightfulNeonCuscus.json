Micks's character is joyfully holding a holographic, shiny Pokémon-style card that features Goobs's smiling face, labeled \"My Rarest Find.\" Goobs's character offers him a lovingly drawn shawarma wrap. The background is a dreamy, warm sunset sky painted in soft washes of peach, lavender, and golden yellow, evoking a feeling of hope and tender love that transcends distance.

Use a nice pen-style appearance with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight. Think of sophisticated calligraphy that's still approachable and easy to read. Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a charming, stylized illustration in a warm, soft color palette reminiscent of watercolor or gouache. The artwork depicts a split scene representing two different locations, connected by a magical, glowing purple and gold aura with small hearts. On the left side, a character labeled \"Goobs\" is shown wearing headphones and holding a shawarma, with a window in the background showing a nighttime cityscape with a crescent moon. On the right side, a character labeled \"Micks\" is shown waving, holding a collectible card with a lion-like creature and the word \"GUARDIAN.\" The background on this side features a window with a European-style building and a potted plant. Both characters are cute, simplified, and expressive. Below the characters, the text \"Happy 2nd Anniversary\" is written in a flowing, elegant, handwritten cursive script. The overall mood is sweet, loving, and conveys a sense of connection despite distance. The art style is flat 2D, suitable for printing, with a full-bleed background.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a whimsical and charming Studio Ghibli-inspired watercolor illustration style. The scene is a serene and minimalist composition, featuring a single, stylized orange tulip with two green leaves, positioned on the right side of the card. To the left of the tulip, a soft, pale yellow heart outline is subtly drawn in a painterly, almost faded brushstroke, suggesting a gentle and loving presence. The background is a uniform, soft creamy beige, creating a peaceful and uncluttered feel. The overall aesthetic is understated and sweet, providing a complementary and gentle conclusion to a visual narrative, with no text or explicit branding. The design is intentionally focused to leave ample space, particularly in the bottom right corner, for a potential QR code or mailing address, adhering to a flat 2D artwork for printing with full-bleed backgrounds.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a deep navy blue, star-filled night sky background. The style is reminiscent of a delicate watercolor illustration with a slight textured paper feel. In the upper portion of the frame, a golden outline of a shawarma wrap is positioned on the left, and a golden outline of a collectible card is on the right. A thin, glowing golden line, dotted with two small golden hearts, arcs between the shawarma and the collectible card, suggesting a connection across distance. The collectible card has a simple, stylized outline of a creature within its frame. Small, scattered golden stars and starbursts are present throughout the sky. The lower portion of the image features a dark, silhouetted landscape of rolling hills or mountains against a dark horizon. Below this, a body of water reflects the shimmering light of the stars and the moon, depicted with gentle, undulating waves in shades of deep blue and highlighted with golden streaks. The overall impression is romantic, serene, and subtly magical, conveying a sense of connection despite physical separation.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a charming watercolor illustration. The artwork features a delicate, stylized floral branch with three orange tulip-like blossoms and green leaves on the left side, curving gently into the center of the page. The background is a soft gradient transitioning from a warm, textured orange on the left to a serene, light blue on the right. In the center, \"Happy Anniversary\" is elegantly written in a flowing, dark brown script font. On the right side, a string of five stylized, heart-shaped orange lanterns hangs vertically, creating a gentle visual counterpoint to the floral branch. The overall aesthetic is sweet, romantic, and artistic, with visible watercolor textures and soft, blended colors."
