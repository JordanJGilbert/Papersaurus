    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design showing two party hats, one slightly larger than the other, resting side-by-side on a soft, fluffy cloud against a pale blue sky. A single, delicate gold ribbon drifts gently from the hats across the center of the image. The style is minimal and serene, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The design provides peaceful closure, with decorative elements focused on the center and left, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty.",

    "leftInterior": "A creative watercolor illustration of a single large, whimsical calendar page. The date is circled with a heart made of two intertwined lines, one gold and one pink, symbolizing two birthdays on one day. The rest of the calendar dates are blurred softly into the background. A few playful, stylized stars and confetti pieces seem to float around the circled date. The artwork has a humorous and lighthearted tone, executed in a watercolor style with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The design is abstract and innovative, with no people.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design where the message is framed by an artistic representation of a shared spotlight. A gentle, circular wash of soft golden light emanates from the center of the page, with whimsical, colorful watercolor confetti appearing to dance and float within its beam. The message is written in the center of this spotlight in an elegant, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are! Love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\". The style is clean and artistic, using soft watercolor washes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds to create a warm and celebratory feel."
