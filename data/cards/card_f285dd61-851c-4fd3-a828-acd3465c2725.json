    "backCover": "A simple and serene watercolor painting that brings closure to the card's story. In the center-left area, a single, oversized birthday candle from the front cover rests on its side, its wick emitting a soft, gentle puff of golden watercolor smoke that drifts whimsically upwards. A few scattered lavender and sunny yellow watercolor splatters float around it, echoing the main color palette. The style is minimal and artistic, with soft colors, visible paper texture, and delicate brush strokes. The bottom-right corner is left intentionally blank and undecorated, providing a peaceful and clean finish.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor painting of a whimsical scene. An elegant, silver-haired grandmother character (Vivi) and a cheerful young girl character with a ponytail (Audrey) are back-to-back, each playfully holding a giant sparkler that fizzles with golden light. They are dressed in complementary party outfits, maybe polka dots for the girl and stripes for the grandmother, in a palette of lavender, soft teal, and sunny yellow. They are standing on a small, grassy hillock under a sky filled with gently floating, oversized birthday candles instead of clouds. The overall atmosphere is joyful and mischievous. Centered in the middle of the design, the text 'Happy Birthday Twins!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, flowing handwritten cursive script. The artwork has soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture, with organic watercolor paint bleeds at the edges for an authentic feel. Key elements like faces and text are kept away from the edges.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent the people in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:\n- REPRESENT ALL PEOPLE: If multiple reference photos are provided, create cartoon versions of ALL people shown, bringing them together in the same scene\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles worn by each person in their reference photo\n- COMPLETE accessories: include ALL accessories visible on each person (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.)\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nStudy every detail of the people in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features.

    "leftInterior": "An innovative and humorous watercolor artwork depicting a 'Greatness Detector'. This is a whimsical, retro-style scientific contraption with dials, antennae, and a large, glowing meter. The machine is painted in soft teals and yellows. The needle on the main dial is pointing dramatically to 'MAXIMUM GREATNESS,' and a small label below the meter reads 'Result: Struck Twice!'. Little sparks of lavender and gold watercolor paint pop from the machine, as if it's working at full capacity. The background is a soft, textured watercolor wash. This abstract and funny concept visually represents the line 'greatness decided to strike twice' from the message, maintaining the card's lighthearted tone without using any characters.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design focusing on the message. Two elegant, intertwined ribbons, one lavender and one soft teal, flow gracefully across the page, creating a beautiful, artistic frame for the text. The ribbons twist and loop playfully, with subtle sunny yellow watercolor splatters accenting the curves, as if from a festive celebration. The ribbons look like they are made of light and color, with soft, translucent edges. Within this decorative frame, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script that feels personal and warm: 'Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey! It's pretty clear that greatness decided to strike twice on the same day, and we're so glad we get to celebrate both of you. May your day be filled with double the cake, double the fun, and only half the shenanigans... maybe.\\n\\nLots of love,\\nThe Gilberts'. The artwork features soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and a visible paper texture consistent with the rest of the card."
