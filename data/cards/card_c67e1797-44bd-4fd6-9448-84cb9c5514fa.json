    "backCover": "A simple and serene watercolor design that provides a peaceful conclusion. The background is a soft, blended wash of the same pastel colors from the front cover. On the left side of the card, a single, elegant red ribbon, matching the one from the front cover, gracefully loops and curls downwards from the top edge, as if it has just been untied. A few delicate watercolor paint splatters in gold and soft pink are scattered around the ribbon. The overall design is minimalist and artistic, leaving the bottom-right corner area completely empty. Style is a watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor scene. Two stylized cartoon characters, a man (Jordan) and a woman (Lao Lao), are depicted in a playful, charming style with simplified, friendly features. The man is proudly presenting himself, wrapped in a giant red birthday bow and ribbon, with a comically oversized gift tag hanging from the bow that says 'To: Lao Lao, From: Jordan'. The woman is laughing joyfully, pointing at him with amusement. They are standing in a softly painted, dreamy landscape with gentle rolling hills in pastel shades. Centered in the sky above them, the text 'Happy Birthday' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The artwork is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, establishing a whimsical and romantic atmosphere.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "An innovative and playful watercolor illustration that continues the 'gift' theme with a humorous twist. The page displays a highly detailed, artistic 'receipt' for a priceless item. The receipt is rendered in a beautiful watercolor style, with soft, faded text and artistic smudges. The item description reads 'One Priceless Boyfriend'. The quantity is '1', and the price column lists whimsical, non-monetary values like 'Unlimited Hugs,' 'A Lifetime of Laughter,' and 'Questionable Dance Moves.' The 'Total' at the bottom is dramatically circled with the word 'PRICELESS!' in bold, flourishing script. The background is a gentle wash of soft pastel colors that harmonize with the rest of the card, with light, celebratory confetti-like paint splatters. This is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and artistic watercolor design framing the message. The background is a soft, elegant wash of pastel colors. A decorative border made of a gracefully flowing red ribbon, echoing the one from the front cover, meanders around the edges of the page, creating a beautiful frame. Intertwined with the ribbon are subtle, shimmering gold watercolor lines and delicate, abstract floral bursts that bloom in soft pink and cream. In the center, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script: 'Happy Birthday to my wonderful girlfriend, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a ridiculously expensive gift, but then I remembered my presence is priceless. You're welcome! I love you more than anything. Love, Jordan'. The handwriting is elegant and personal, with a natural, flowing character. The artwork is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds."
