    "backCover": "A simple and elegant minimalist design on a soft white background. In the center-left area, a single, beautifully illustrated amethyst geode rock is depicted, its crystalline structures rendered with clean lines and subtle purple and lavender watercolor washes. Next to it sits a single, perfectly flaky croissant, drawn with the same delicate, minimalist line art style. The composition is clean, serene, and asymmetrical, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. This design provides a peaceful, artistic conclusion, echoing the purple and croissant motifs from the card's interior.",
    "frontCover": "A minimalist, whimsical illustration in a Japanese animation art style. A young girl with short brown hair and a purple bow is giving a gentle kiss on the cheek to a woman with longer, wavy brown hair. They are both smiling joyfully. The scene is set against a soft, pale lavender background with plenty of negative space. A few delicate, hand-painted croissants float whimsically around them like butterflies. The overall feeling is tender and celebratory. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday Twins!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, playful handwritten cursive script. The art style is flat 2D, with clean lines, simple shapes, and a pastel purple-dominant color palette.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "A creative minimalist pattern against a clean white background. A playful, scattered arrangement of stylized, flat 2D illustrations of key elements: golden-brown croissants, sparkling purple amethyst rocks of various simple shapes, and whimsical swirls of lavender-colored ice cream in minimalist cones. The items are arranged dynamically, as if floating gently across the page, creating an energetic yet clean pattern. The design uses clean lines, simple shapes, and the established purple and gold color palette, maintaining a fun and sophisticated aesthetic with plenty of white space.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful, minimalist design elegantly framing the handwritten message. On a clean white background, a graceful, sweeping swirl of lavender-colored watercolor paint arcs from the top-left corner down towards the bottom-right, resembling a playful brushstroke of ice cream batter. A few delicately drawn, stylized purple amethyst rock shapes are artfully placed along this swirl. The message is centrally located, written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script: 'Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey! It's pretty clear that greatness decided to strike twice on the same day, and we're so glad we get to celebrate both of you. May your day be filled with double the cake, double the fun, and only half the shenanigans... maybe.\nLots of Love,\nThe Gilberts'. The composition is artistic, uncluttered, and focuses on the heartfelt text."
