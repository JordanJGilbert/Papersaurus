Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards.

Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code.
