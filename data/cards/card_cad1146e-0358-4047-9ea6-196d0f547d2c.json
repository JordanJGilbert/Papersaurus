    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene back cover for a greeting card. The design features a single, elegantly melting scoop of red, white, and blue swirled ice cream from the front cover, depicted in the top center. The ice cream is rendered in a soft, 2D flat watercolor style with gentle paint bleeds and visible brushstrokes, set against a plain, light cream-colored background with a subtle paper texture. The overall composition is clean and simple. IMPORTANT: The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, must be left completely blank and undecorated for QR code placement.",
    "frontCover": "A full-shot, 2D flat watercolor illustration for a greeting card front. The scene depicts a humorous and joyful moment between two stylized cartoon characters, Jordan and Lao Lao, created from the provided reference photo. They are at the Great America amusement park on the Fourth of July. In the background, a whimsical, slightly wonky-looking rollercoaster loops against a soft blue sky filled with distant, colorful firework bursts rendered with soft paint bleeds. Jordan is playfully trying to feed Lao Lao a giant, comically oversized cone of red, white, and blue swirled ice cream, but he's missing her mouth, and a dollop of ice cream is comically stuck to her cheek, which she is laughing at with a wide, happy expression. Jordan has a look of goofy concentration. Both characters are wearing festive, casual summer outfits. The entire scene is painted in a lighthearted watercolor style with soft, flowing colors, visible artistic brushstrokes, and a subtle paper texture. In the center of the card, floating over the scene, the words \"Thank You\" are written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "A beautiful decorative art piece for the left interior of a greeting card. The artwork is a full-bleed abstract pattern inspired by the Fourth of July fireworks from the front cover. It features a cascade of soft, exploding firework shapes in red, white, and blue, rendered as beautiful watercolor paint splatters and bleeds. The design is light, airy, and festive, painted in a soft watercolor style with visible artistic brushstrokes and a subtle paper texture, matching the card's overall aesthetic. There are no people or text.",
    "rightInterior": "The right interior of a greeting card, featuring a decorative watercolor background. The background is a gentle wash of soft blue and light cream watercolor, with subtle, abstract firework bursts in red and white bleeding softly in the corners. Integrated beautifully into the artwork, the following message is written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script: \"Lao Lao, thanks for an amazing summer! I'm still not sure what was more explosive, the Fourth of July fireworks or my stomach after all those rollercoasters at the amusement park. Honestly, surviving both with you officially makes you the best girlfriend ever.\\n\\nAll my love,\\nJordan\". The text is centered, with key elements kept away from the edges for safe printing. The style is consistent with the front cover, with soft colors, visible brushstrokes, and a paper texture. No people or characters are included."
