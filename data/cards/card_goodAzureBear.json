The tree's bark is rendered with textured ink linework in shades of brown and grey, adding depth and detail. The base of the tree is surrounded by soft, muted green brushstrokes suggesting grass and undergrowth, with a gentle gradient of yellow-ochre and warm sienna at the roots. The background is a soft, warm cream wash that transitions into a very light, desaturated green towards the bottom, providing a gentle and harmonious contrast to the tree. Below the tree, the text \"JOHN GILBERT\" is displayed in a clear, elegant serif font in black. Beneath that, \"AI FOR GOOD\" is also in the same serif font. The final line reads \"JUNE 2025\", using the same typography. The overall mood is peaceful, grounded, and inspiring, with a professional yet heartfelt aesthetic.",
