    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor painting on a textured paper background. A single, long, flowing ribbon, matching the one from the front cover's gift box, drifts gracefully across the center of the card from the left side. A few stray pieces of colorful confetti, echoing the design from the interior, are scattered lightly around the ribbon. The overall composition is simple, elegant, and provides a peaceful visual conclusion. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left blank and undecorated. The style is consistent with the rest of the card, featuring soft colors and artistic paint bleeds.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor painting of four charming, stylized cartoon animals\u2014a clever fox (John), a graceful swan (Christina), a playful squirrel (Jasmine), and a friendly bear (Jordan)\u2014all squeezed together inside a single, beautifully wrapped gift box that's slightly too small for them. The box is tied with a giant, flowing ribbon, and the animals are peeking out with comical expressions of delight and mild chaos. The background is a soft, cheerful wash of pastel watercolors. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is whimsical and artistic, with soft flowing colors, visible brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background.",
    "leftInterior": "An explosion of joyful, abstract watercolor confetti and streamers cascades down the page. The shapes are varied\u2014dots, squiggles, and tiny starbursts\u2014in a vibrant, harmonious color palette that matches the front cover. Interspersed among the confetti are whimsical, hand-drawn illustrations of party objects: a single party popper in mid-pop, a funny party hat askew, and a slice of birthday cake with an exaggeratedly tall, curly candle. The composition is dynamic and full of energy, conveying a sense of celebration and fun. The design is purely illustrative and abstract, with no characters or text, rendered in a soft watercolor style with visible brush strokes and paint bleeds on a textured paper background.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design with the handwritten message as the central focus. The text is framed by an artistic, whimsical border made of intertwined, flowing ribbons and delicate, sparkling confetti that seem to float around the words. The design elegantly contains the message without overwhelming it. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We got together and decided that for your gift this year, you get the pleasure of our amazing company. You're welcome! We hope your day is as fantastic as you are (and as fun as we are). All our love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\". The message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant, warm, and personal, with a natural pen-and-ink flow. The watercolor background has soft, blended colors, artistic brush strokes, and a gentle paper texture."
