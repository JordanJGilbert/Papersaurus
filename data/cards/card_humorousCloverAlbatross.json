This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a whimsical and heartwarming watercolor illustration style. The scene depicts two adorable, cuddly bearsâ€”one slightly larger (Gene) and one slightly smaller (Phoebe)â€”sitting close together on a park bench under a softly glowing streetlamp, sharing a single long scarf. The larger bear is wearing a tiny, charmingly illustrated basketball jersey, perhaps with a little heart on it. The background is a dreamy, soft-focus blend of warm purples and dusky oranges, suggesting a beautiful sunset or a cozy evening. Scattered around them are gentle, translucent watercolor washes that bleed softly into the paper, creating a feeling of tenderness and warmth. The entire illustration has visible, delicate ink linework, giving it a personal, hand-drawn feel, as if sketched with love in a personal journal. The colors are soft and inviting, emphasizing the deep affection and longing in the message.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY!

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card, in a whimsical and heartwarming illustration style with a touch of digital painting. The scene is set at night, under a large, glowing full moon that casts a warm, golden light. The background features a deep navy blue sky with a subtle texture, dotted with small, soft yellow glowing specks like distant stars or fireflies. Hanging from the top edge are stylized, dark blue-green willow branches with delicate, elongated leaves, creating a canopy effect. In the foreground, two adorable, stylized otters are floating in dark blue water, depicted with simple, rounded shapes and warm brown fur. The otter on the left is larger and lying on its back, happily cradling a small, stylized basketball with both paws. The otter on the right is smaller, also floating, and holding a glowing, delicate lotus flower in its paws, emitting a soft yellow light. The water is rendered with gentle, wavy lines in varying shades of blue, with subtle reflections of the moon and glowing specks. The overall color palette is dominated by deep blues, warm golds, and soft browns, creating a serene and romantic atmosphere. The text \"My One and Only\" is prominently displayed in a beautiful, flowing, light cream-colored handwritten cursive script, positioned centrally in the upper half of the image, safely away from the top and bottom edges. The style is charming and sweet, with a sense of tender affection.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a romantic greeting card with a serene, minimalist aesthetic. The artwork features a deep navy blue background depicting a calm body of water at night. A large, golden full moon is positioned in the upper left quadrant, casting a luminous reflection on the water in a series of horizontal, stylized golden shapes. In the lower half of the image, a single golden lotus flower floats on the water, its petals gently unfurling. The lotus is supported by a dark, stylized stem that forms an infinity symbol, subtly hinting at eternal love. A few small, scattered white dots represent distant stars. Three small, stylized flying insects, possibly fireflies or dragonflies, are scattered in the upper right section of the scene, adding a touch of ethereal movement. The overall color palette is limited to deep blues, golden yellows, and subtle whites, creating a peaceful and intimate atmosphere. The bottom right corner of the card is reserved for a white square containing a black QR code. The design deliberately avoids any text or characters, focusing solely on evocative imagery to provide a quiet, contemplative conclusion to the card's visual narrative. The style is flat, 2D illustration with clean lines and distinct color blocking, evoking a modern yet timeless feel, perfectly complementing a sophisticated and loving tone.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a love greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a stylized, artistic map of California silhouetted against a deep, starry night sky. The silhouette is filled with a subtle, textured watercolor effect in varying shades of deep blue and indigo, giving it depth and a celestial feel. A glowing, golden trail of light, resembling stardust or a shooting star, originates from the northern part of the state, arcs across the map, and forms a luminous heart shape in the upper right quadrant. Within the silhouette of California, two bright, glowing orbs of golden light mark specific locations, connected by the same golden trail. One orb is positioned in the northern part of the state, and another is located further south. A small, stylized illustration of a basketball is subtly integrated into the golden trail between these two points, hinting at the basketball theme. The overall artistic style is painterly and ethereal, with a focus on light and subtle texture, creating a romantic and dreamy atmosphere that visually represents distance and connection. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and contrasting golden yellows, evoking a sense of wonder and longing. The background is a dark, speckled canvas representing a vast night sky, with scattered points of light that mimic distant stars. There is no text on this interior page. The composition is designed to be visually striking and emotionally resonant, complementing the narrative of love and connection across distance.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical and heartwarming watercolor illustration style. The background is a soft, pale lavender with subtle watercolor textures. Framing the text are delicate, sweeping branches with stylized, muted lavender leaves, rendered with visible, fine ink linework. Interspersed among the foliage are small, scattered, soft yellow glows, like tiny fireflies or distant stars. The main message is presented in a beautiful, legible, flowing gold cursive script. The text reads: \"My Dearest Gene Hern pookie, I MISS YOU SO MUCH IN STANFORD AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU SOON I LOVE YOUUU All my love, Phoebe Du your pookie\". The handwriting has a natural, warm character, with slight variations in line weight suggesting a gentle ink flow. A subtle, wavy gold line separates the main body of the message from the closing. The composition is balanced, with the decorative elements guiding the eye towards the heartfelt message."
