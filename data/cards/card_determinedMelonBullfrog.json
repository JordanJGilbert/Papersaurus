Avoid generic or clichÃ© designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"Yu was born in a dog year. Yu works in the interaction of AI and physical world. Yu likes traveling and outdoors.\"\nStyle: âœ¨ Smart Style\nTone: ðŸ˜„ Funny - humorous and lighthearted\nTo: Yu\nFrom: Yu\nMessage: \"Help me write\"\n\nReference: \"artistic transformation\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a whimsical and heartwarming storybook illustration style. The scene is rendered in soft, textured watercolors with visible, gentle brushstrokes, giving it a cozy, handmade feel. A charming, illustrated character representing Yu, inspired by the reference photo, is joyfully hiking through a sun-dappled, magical forest. By their side is an adorable, friendly dog companion, nodding to the \"dog year\" birth, perhaps with a slightly stylized, almost Ghibli-esque design. The \"AI and physical world\" interaction is subtly and poetically represented not by technology, but by glowing, ethereal butterflies or fireflies that the character is interacting with, suggesting a harmonious blend of the magical and the natural. The color palette is warm and inviting, dominated by golden hour sunlight, soft greens, and earthy tones, evoking a sense of peaceful adventure and happy contemplation.\n\n2.

The background is a soft, creamy parchment with visible, gentle brushstrokes, evoking a cozy, handmade feel. Dominating the scene is a large scroll displaying a complex, whimsical diagram filled with quirky equations, symbols, and illustrative elements that represent the interaction of AI and the physical world.

The surrounding decorative element is a stylized, glowing turquoise line that forms an organic, interwoven loop, reminiscent of a playful roller coaster or an abstract natural vine. This loop encircles the text and incorporates small, subtle icons: at the top, a neon outline of a dog paw print; just above and slightly to the right of the text, a neon outline of a birthday cake with a lit candle; and at the bottom right, a neon outline of the Earth. The line itself is a vibrant turquoise, outlined with a subtle white glow and dotted with small, scattered yellow and blue light particles, suggesting a magical or digital energy. The background is a deep, gradient teal transitioning to a dark, slightly blurred indigo at the top. The bottom half of the background features a simplified, illustrative landscape of lush, stylized green foliage with hints of yellow flowers and scattered yellow dots representing light.
