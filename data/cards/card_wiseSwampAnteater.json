The scene depicts two cartoon animals, a sloth and a monkey, wearing party hats and riding a unicycle through a sky filled with colorful confetti. The sloth, in front, has a mischievous grin and wide eyes, while the monkey behind it is ecstatic with its mouth open in a cheer and one arm raised in the air. A faint, glowing yellow streak follows the unicycle, suggesting movement. Below them, a stylized cartoon character, a young man in graduation attire (robe and lei), sits on a ledge, looking up at the animals with a wide, happy smile. The background features muted, classical-style buildings and greenery. The text 'Happy Birthday!' is prominently displayed in a playful, bold, brown font, positioned in the lower-middle section of the card, ensuring safe printing margins. The overall color palette is vibrant yet soft, with a dominant light blue sky, warm browns and grays for the animals, and bright accents for the confetti and lei. The mood is humorous, lighthearted, and celebratory.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a funny birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, continuing the charming and whimsical caricature style. The design subtly references the front cover with a single, stylized golden confetti piece arcing gently across the light blue background, reminiscent of the confetti and movement from the front.

The overall mood is serene and subtly joyful, complementing the front cover's energetic humor.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior page of a funny birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, rendered in a charming and whimsical caricature style with colored pencils and soft watercolor washes. This page features a close-up, dynamic composition of the sloth and monkey on the unicycle, captured mid-air with the colorful confetti raining down around them. The sloth's comically exaggerated grumpy expression and the monkey's gleeful excitement are emphasized. The golden streak from the front cover is more pronounced here, swirling around the unicycle. The background is a soft, gradient wash of light blue, allowing the characters and confetti to pop. The style emphasizes expressive linework and joyful, vibrant colors, consistent with the front cover, creating a sense of fun and playful chaos that builds on the initial introduction.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior page of a funny birthday greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a charming and whimsical caricature style with colored pencils and soft watercolor washes.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a minimalist, clean, and whimsical artistic style. The background is a very pale, almost white-blue. In the lower left quadrant, a stylized, flat illustration of a unicycle is depicted lying on its side. The unicycle has a black wheel with thin spokes and a black frame extending to a simple, curved seat. Above and to the right of the unicycle, a subtle trail of abstract, scattered elements suggests movement or a gentle gust of wind. This trail consists of a few soft, blurred golden specks that blend into the background, interspersed with a few small, solid, oval shapes in bright orange and light blue. These colorful dots are scattered upwards and to the right, creating a sense of airy playfulness. There is no text on this back cover, and no space is reserved for a QR code, allowing the simple, evocative imagery to provide a quiet, artistic conclusion to the card's visual narrative. The overall impression is one of lightheartedness and subtle charm, harmonizing with a humorous and lighthearted tone.",

    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical and colorful border of dripping birthday candles and swirling party streamers in vibrant shades of orange, yellow, green, purple, and blue. The background is a light, serene blue. The text \"Happy Birthday!\" is prominently displayed at the top in a playful, dark purple font. Below this, the main message is presented in a clear, legible sans-serif font, also in dark purple, occupying the central area. The decorative elements frame the text, creating a visual celebration that complements the humorous and lighthearted tone of the message, with no specific artistic style mentioned for the border beyond its playful nature. The overall composition is flat 2D artwork suitable for printing.\n\nHere's a detailed prompt that could have been used to create this image:\n\n\"Flat 2D artwork for a birthday greeting card interior, 9:16 aspect ratio. The background is a soft, light blue. Dominating the left and right edges of the page is a whimsical, artistic border composed of stylized, dripping birthday candles in vibrant, saturated colors: orange, yellow, lime green, deep purple, and aqua blue. These candles are depicted with thick, melted wax drips, and each has a bright, warm flame. Intertwined with the candles are playful, swirling party streamers and ribbons in coordinating bright colors, including red, orange, yellow, blue, and purple. Some streamers are depicted as long, flowing ribbons, while others are depicted as coiled party blowers. These decorative elements fill the left and right sides of the card, curving inwards and creating a natural framing for the central text.\n\nPositioned in the upper central area of the card, with safe margins from the top edge, is the greeting text: 'Happy Birthday!' This text is rendered in a bold, playful, sans-serif font with a dark purple outline and fills, creating a strong visual anchor.\n\nBelow the 'Happy Birthday!' greeting, occupying the majority of the central space, is the main message text: 'I was going to make an age-related joke, but honestly, I'm just impressed you're still putting up with me after all this time. You deserve a medal... or at least a really big piece of cake. Hope your day is as awesome as you are!' This text is presented in a clear, readable, dark purple, sans-serif font, with generous line spacing to accommodate potential handwritten messages. The text is carefully placed within the central area, ensuring it is well-separated from the ornate borders and remains at least 10% away from the top and bottom edges.\n\nThe overall style is cheerful, illustrative, and cartoon-like, with a focus on bright, contrasting colors and playful shapes that convey a humorous and lighthearted tone. The linework is clean and defined, with a slight cartoonish exaggeration in the candle drips and streamer shapes. The image should evoke a sense of joyful celebration, with the decorative elements enhancing, rather than overwhelming, the message space. Ensure the entire design adheres to a full-bleed background, with no white borders, and all key elements like text and the main decorative motifs are kept away from the absolute edges to account for printing. The artistic style is consistent with a charming and whimsical caricature, hand-drawn with colored pencils and a touch of soft watercolor wash, focusing on joyful and celebratory colors and loose, expressive linework.\n\nThe visual narrative continues from the front cover, maintaining a cohesive color palette and playful artistic style. The emphasis is on creating a visually engaging and fun space for the birthday message.\""
