Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"funny card\"\nStyle: \u2728 Smart Style\nTone: \ud83d\ude04 Funny - humorous and lighthearted\n\n\nMessage: \"Happy birthday! I was going to make an age-related joke, but honestly, I'm just impressed you're still putting up with me after all this time. You deserve a medal... or at least a really big piece of cake. Hope your day is as awesome as you are!\"\n\nReference: \"artistic transformation\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a charming and whimsical caricature style, hand-drawn with colored pencils and a touch of soft watercolor wash. The features from the reference photo are comically exaggerated with a loving and playful hand, focusing on a signature smile or expressive eyes to capture the subject's personality. The linework is loose and expressive, filled with warm, vibrant colors that feel joyful and celebratory. The background is minimal, perhaps a soft, cheerful color wash, ensuring the funny and heartfelt portrait remains the star of the show, creating a truly personal and smile-inducing keepsake.\n\n2.
