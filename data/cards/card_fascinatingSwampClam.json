Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features.

Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a gentle and evocative watercolor and ink wash style. The scene is rendered with soft, flowing colors that bleed into one another, creating a dreamy and nostalgic atmosphere. Delicate ink lines with varying weights define the key elements, capturing the charm and detail of the moment without being rigid. The color palette is warm and inviting, featuring cherry blossom pinks, the deep indigo of traditional textiles, and the golden glow of a setting sun, all rendered on a textured, off-white paper background. The overall effect is personal, painterly, and filled with the quiet joy of a cherished memory.\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.

    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card in a vibrant, graphic illustration style with a retro comic book feel. The scene depicts a lively Japanese festival at dusk, rendered in bold, flat colors with thick black outlines and a subtle dot-screen texture. The color palette is dominated by a striking teal sky, bright pink accents, and warm yellow highlights. The central focus is a cartoonishly depicted young couple and a mischievous raccoon-like creature. The woman, on the left, wears glasses and has a panicked expression, her mouth agape, as her green soft-serve ice cream melts down the cone and onto her hand. The man, on the right, has a wide, excited grin, his eyes wide with anticipation. Between them, a small, orange raccoon-like character with a happy, slightly smug expression holds a skewer of three dango balls. In the background, traditional Japanese lanterns, some glowing pink, hang from poles, and stylized temple architecture is visible, silhouetted against the teal sky. The text \\\"JAPAN TRIP 2025\\\" is prominently displayed at the top in large, bold, yellow, sans-serif lettering with a black outline, conveying a sense of energetic excitement. The overall mood is humorous and lighthearted, capturing a moment of delightful chaos during a trip.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card in a vibrant, graphic illustration style with a retro comic book feel, matching the front cover. The scene is a minimalist, decorative composition focusing on repeating motifs. The background is a solid, bright pink with a subtle dot-screen texture. Across the center and extending towards the left, stylized, glowing red Japanese lanterns are depicted in a repeating pattern. Some lanterns are larger and more detailed, while others are smaller and faded, creating a sense of depth. Interspersed between the lanterns are small, scattered yellow circular elements, perhaps representing confetti or tiny glowing orbs. The color palette of teal, pink, and yellow from the front cover is maintained, with the teal only appearing as thin outlines on the lanterns and the yellow used for the accents. The composition is clean and uncluttered, with the bottom-right corner intentionally left blank for a QR code. The overall effect is a serene yet visually interesting conclusion, hinting at the celebratory atmosphere of the trip without depicting characters.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a bright yellow background featuring a subtle, repeating dot pattern. Dominating the lower left quadrant is a playful, abstract green blob with thick black outlines, reminiscent of spilled paint or a friendly blob monster. Emanating from this central shape are smaller, scattered splatters and teardrop shapes in bright teal and magenta, also with bold black outlines. These elements create a sense of energetic, whimsical motion. The overall style is flat, graphic, and bold, with a slightly retro comic book feel. There is no text and no people on this back cover. The entire image is designed to be full-bleed. There is no visible reserved space for a QR code, but the design naturally leaves ample negative space in the upper right two-thirds of the card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a vibrant, playful, and humorous \"Smart Style\" illustration. The background is a cheerful, bright yellow with a subtle, all-over halftone dot pattern in a slightly darker yellow, creating a retro-pop feel. Dominating the left side of the frame is a large, organic, abstract shape resembling a green ink splash or blob, rendered in a flat, bold style with a thick, black outline. This central green shape has multiple irregular, flowing protrusions, suggesting dynamic movement. Emanating from this central splash are smaller, teardrop-shaped elements in bright teal and hot pink, also outlined in black. These smaller splashes are scattered around the larger green shape, some appearing to be actively exploding outwards, reinforcing the sense of energetic fun. The overall composition is minimalistic and graphic, relying on strong shapes and contrasting colors to convey a lighthearted and exciting mood. The style is distinctly flat 2D artwork, suitable for printing, with a full-bleed background that extends to all edges. The artistic choice is to create an unexpected and memorable visual that is humorous and whimsical, perfectly fitting the \"Celebrating our good times in Japan 2025\" theme with an emphasis on energetic fun.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, humorous, and artistically unique \"Smart Style\" illustration. The scene depicts a bustling Japanese festival atmosphere, rendered in a flat 2D cartoon style with bold outlines and a limited, high-contrast color palette of teal, yellow, pink, and black. The background features stylized Japanese lanterns and temple-like structures, creating a lively yet slightly chaotic backdrop. In the foreground, two cartoon characters are comically reacting to their experiences: one, with wide, panicked eyes and sweat drops, is holding a melting green ice cream cone that is dripping profusely; the other character, beaming with delight, is holding a skewer of dango (sweet dumplings). A playful, cartoon raccoon character, inspired by the front cover's style, is positioned between them, eagerly reaching for the dango. The overall composition is dynamic, with a sense of movement conveyed through scattered elements like dripping ice cream and small, abstract shapes. The artistic style is reminiscent of retro comic book art, with a deliberate use of halftone dots to create texture. There is no printed text on this interior page; it is entirely dedicated to visual storytelling and leaves ample space for handwritten messages, with the main decorative elements strategically placed to the sides and above the central figures."
