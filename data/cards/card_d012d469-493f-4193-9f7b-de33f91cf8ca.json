    "frontCover": "A full-shot, 2D flat illustration for a thank-you greeting card front cover, in a dreamy fantasy anime style.\n\n**Scene:** Two stylized cartoon characters, based on the provided reference photo of \"Lao Lao\" and \"Jordan,\" are riding a whimsical, magical roller coaster car together at Great America amusement park. The roller coaster track, made of glowing pastel rainbow light, spirals gracefully through a starry, lavender-hued twilight sky filled with soft, fluffy clouds. The characters are in a moment of pure, humorous joy. \"Jordan\" has a comically terrified yet thrilled expression, clutching the safety bar with white knuckles, his hair blown straight back. \"Lao Lao\" is laughing heartily, arms thrown up in the air in excitement, completely unfazed and enjoying the ride.\n\n**Details:** Instead of typical fireworks, the sky is bursting with vibrant, sparkling Fourth of July \"fire-flowers\" that bloom and gently float down like glowing petals. The amusement park in the background is a fantasy version, with fairy-tale castles, cotton candy clouds, and glowing Ferris wheels. The scene is framed by delicate, enchanted tree branches with luminous, magical blossoms, adding to the detailed nature and whimsical atmosphere.\n\n**Characters:** Create stylized cartoon characters that accurately represent \"Lao Lao\" and \"Jordan\" from the reference photo, capturing their likenesses in a fun, anime-inspired style with expressive, humorous faces.\n\n**Color Palette:** Soft pastels dominate\u2014lavender, baby blue, mint green, and cotton-candy pink, with pops of glowing gold and vibrant fire-flower colors to create a magical, enchanting atmosphere.\n\n**Text:** In the safe center area of the composition, the words \"Thank You\" are written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The font color is a soft, glowing white with a subtle pink outline to stand out against the background.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.
