    "backCover": "A simple, minimalist design with a clean, full-bleed soft sky-blue background. A small, stylized graphic of a single hot dog wearing sunglasses is positioned in the top-center. The bottom-right corner is left intentionally clear for a QR code.",
    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration in a Smart Style of a cool, anthropomorphic hot dog wearing sunglasses and a patriotic top hat, dramatically fumbling a tray of fellow hot dogs mid-air. The hot dogs have comical shocked expressions. The background is a vibrant, full-bleed pattern of red, white, and blue geometric shapes on a soft sky-blue backdrop. Centered text in a playful, bold font reads \"Happy Fourth of July\". The main character is positioned centrally, away from edges.",
    "leftInterior": "A humorous scene continuing the front cover's theme. A mischievous squirrel, wearing a tiny patriotic bowtie, is shown running away with one of the dropped hot dogs. The background is a soft, grassy texture under a blue sky, with subtle firework bursts in the far distance. The style remains flat 2D with a warm, sunny color palette.",
    "rightInterior": "A clean, soft sky-blue background matching the back cover. In the center, the placeholder text \"Sam,\n\nHope your Fourth is more \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" and less \"oops, I dropped the hot dogs.\" Have a blast celebrating and try not to lose any eyebrows to the sparklers this year!\n\nHappy Fourth!\nJordan\" is elegantly written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script. The text is framed by two small, minimalist star illustrations, one on each side."
