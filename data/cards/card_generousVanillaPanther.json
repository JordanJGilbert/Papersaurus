    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a digital art style. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and purples, with accents of bright pink and white. The main subject is a cute, friendly robot with a white and pink body and a large, black screen for a face displaying a wide, smiling emoticon with pink curved eyebrows and mouth. The robot stands on a dark, geometric platform. Its right hand is outstretched, holding a glowing pink crystal. The background features a dark, out-of-focus starry or digital network pattern with subtle pink and blue highlights. The text \"Thank you\" is prominently displayed at the top of the card in a glowing, neon blue sans-serif font with a slight glow effect. The overall mood is cheerful, futuristic, and appreciative.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a digital, futuristic aesthetic. The background is a deep, dark navy blue, speckled with numerous small, glowing points of light resembling stars or digital particles, in shades of light blue, pink, and purple. Centered in the upper half of the card is a stylized, geometric lotus flower. The lotus is rendered as if made of translucent, faceted crystal or glowing neon outlines. Its petals are a vibrant magenta and pink gradient, with thinner, glowing blue outlines defining the facets and edges. Emerging from the base of the lotus and extending downwards towards the bottom edge of the card is a network of thin, glowing blue lines and circuits, interspersed with smaller glowing pink and blue dots. These lines create a sense of data flow or energy transmission. There is no visible text or QR code placement. The design provides a sophisticated and visually striking closure, extending the thematic visual of light, growth, and perhaps digital transformation from the front of the card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a minimalist, flat design. The artwork features a stylized tree-like structure or circuit board pattern rendered in bright pink and vibrant cyan lines against a deep navy blue background. The lines are clean and geometric, branching outwards from a central point at the bottom and spreading across the page. At the ends of many of these branches are stylized, eight-petaled flowers in bright pink, varying in size from small to a large, prominent bloom at the top. Smaller circular dots in pink and cyan are placed at some of the junctions of the branches, further enhancing the circuit board aesthetic. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, with the design filling the majority of the space. The style evokes a blend of organic floral elements with a modern, technological feel, creating a visually harmonious and eye-catching graphic.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a deep navy blue background. The main text area is centrally located and has ample room for handwritten messages. The design features an abstract, flowing border made of thin, luminous lines in electric blue and neon pink, creating a sense of movement and energy. This border is more prominent on the left side, forming a wave-like shape that curves inwards. On the top right and bottom left corners, there are stylized, four-petaled flowers in a vibrant fuchsia color, with a subtle glow. The border elements are accented with small, scattered dots of light in blue and pink, mimicking digital particles. The typography for the pre-printed text is a clean, sans-serif font in white, with \"Craig,\" at the top, followed by the main message, and concluding with \"All the best,\" and \"Jordan.\" The overall aesthetic is modern, slightly futuristic, and visually engaging, balancing the decorative elements with clear, open space for personalization."
