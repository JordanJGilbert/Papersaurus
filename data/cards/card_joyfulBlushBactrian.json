    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a \\\"thinking-of-you\\\" greeting. The artwork is in a stylized cartoon style with flat 2D design, using a vibrant and slightly muted color palette dominated by teal blue for the background, cream for a sign/easel, and a deep blue suit with an orange tie. The main subject is a charming, round pug character wearing a smart blue suit, a crisp white shirt, and a bright orange tie. The pug has a slightly grumpy, yet endearing expression with exaggeratedly furrowed brows and large, soulful dark eyes. It stands upright, holding two small brown briefcases, one in each paw. To the right of the pug, a cream-colored sign or easel displays bold, orange text that reads \\\"PUG-tential UNLIMITED, INC.\\\", with two thin yellow lines underlining \\\"UNLIMITED\\\". The main greeting \\\"Thinking of You, Future Investor...\\\" is prominently displayed in large, off-white, sans-serif, slightly playful block letters on the left side of the teal background, positioned safely away from the edges. The overall mood is humorous and business-oriented with a whimsical, adorable twist due to the pug character.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio. This section features a simple, minimalist decorative design with a full-bleed background in the same teal blue as the front cover. Subtle, abstract representations of business motifs are present, possibly faint geometric patterns or stylized briefcase shapes in a lighter shade of teal or white, concentrated towards the center and left side of the card. A small, circular, off-white area is left intentionally blank in the bottom right corner, reserved for a QR code. The design is serene and complementary to the front cover, offering a peaceful conclusion without any text or characters, maintaining the stylized cartoon aesthetic. The mood is understated and clean.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior page of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio. This page continues the humorous, business-themed narrative with the same stylized cartoon art style, consistent color palette (teal, cream, blue, orange), and flat 2D design. The page depicts the same round pug character, dressed in its blue suit and orange tie, now seemingly in the middle of a business presentation. The pug is standing behind a simple, abstract representation of a desk or podium, looking directly at the viewer with its signature grumpy-yet-cute expression. Behind the pug, a stylized, cream-colored chart or graph rises, perhaps indicating upward trends, in a simplified, illustrative style. The background remains the solid teal blue. The overall composition focuses on developing the story of the 'pug-investor' in a lighthearted, humorous context, maintaining the charm and playful tone of the greeting card.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior page of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, continuing the visual story with the same stylized cartoon art style, color palette, and flat 2D design.

The script is legible, flowing, and warm, conveying genuine affection. The message reads: \\\"We loooove you please invest in our company \\\". This handwritten text is artfully integrated with decorative elements that are both innovative and complementary to the theme, avoiding clichÃ©s. These decorative elements might include stylized, abstract representations of growing business charts, coin stacks, or playful piggy banks, rendered in the card's established color palette (teal, cream, blues, oranges). The pug character is not present on this page, allowing the message and its artistic framing to be the central focus, creating the emotional climax of the card's visual narrative.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist, flat 2D illustration style. The background is a solid, muted teal color. The composition features an open, stylized briefcase or suitcase with a black outline, tilted slightly to the left. Inside the briefcase, there are several bone-shaped objects and small, rectangular pieces of paper with simple line-drawn text or lists on them. Some of these bone shapes and papers have spilled out of the briefcase onto the teal background. To the right of the spilled items, a small, solid black paw print is positioned in the lower right quadrant. There is ample empty space on the background, particularly in the upper and middle areas, suggesting a reserved area for a QR code in the bottom right corner without explicitly showing a QR code. The overall aesthetic is clean, playful, and subtly hints at a \"treats\" or \"business\" theme, aligning with a humorous and lighthearted tone.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a charming, whimsical children's storybook illustration style. The scene depicts the interior of a stylized house, divided into four distinct panels, presented in a 9:16 aspect ratio. The overall color palette is dominated by muted teal for the background and sky, warm browns for the house structure and furniture, and soft creams and yellows for the pug characters and interior details. The art style is flat 2D with a hand-drawn aesthetic, featuring visible pencil textures and a slightly naive, earnest quality, reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations. The lighting is soft and even, creating a gentle, inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe top left panel shows a \"laboratory\" scene with four pug characters wearing white lab coats and tiny spectacles. They are engaged in scientific activities, holding beakers, test tubes, and what appears to be a brightly colored cookie. A rubber ducky also resides in this panel.\n\nThe top right panel displays a meeting room where several pug characters are gathered around a circular table, appearing to be asleep or intensely focused on papers. Office chairs and a desk plant are visible.\n\nThe bottom left panel features a vault door with a large pile of golden, circular objects (resembling dog biscuits or coins) spilling out. Two pug characters stand in front of it; one is holding a small abacus and the other a clipboard.\n\nThe bottom right panel shows another room with a circular table and chairs, where more pug characters are either resting or engrossed in paperwork, all with a sleepy demeanor.\n\nThe entire composition is cohesive, with consistent character design and artistic execution across all panels, suggesting a unified narrative within the greeting card. The overall tone is humorous and lighthearted, with the pugs' earnest yet somewhat drowsy expressions adding to the charm. The image is designed to be full-bleed, with decorative elements extending to the edges.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a humorous and lighthearted tone, rendered in a charming, whimsical children's storybook illustration style. The scene features a detailed blueprint for a \"REVOLUTIONARY NEW DOG TOY\" presented on a vibrant blue background reminiscent of drafting paper. The blueprint illustration itself is drawn with clean, white lines, depicting a stylized, rope-like dog toy with a \"squeaker\" element and text annotations like \"wow!\", \"super chewy,\" and a paw print. Dominating the lower half of the blueprint, in a clear, playful, handwritten cursive script, is the message: \"We loooove you... please invest in our company! -The Kids\". The handwriting has natural character and warmth, with slight variations in line weight, mimicking genuine penmanship. The overall color palette consists of warm browns for the desk and wooden elements, a rich teal for the wall, and vibrant golden hues for the ornate frame of the pug portrait above. Soft, warm lighting creates a gentle, inviting atmosphere. The composition is balanced, with the blueprint and message taking center stage, allowing ample visual interest without overcrowding the space meant for personalization. The style emphasizes a hand-crafted, slightly naive quality with visible textures, evoking a sense of earnestness and affection from \"The Kids.\""
