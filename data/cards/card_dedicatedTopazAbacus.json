    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a retro-futuristic, cosmic cartoon style. The overall color palette is dominated by dark blues and purples, with vibrant neon accents of pink, blue, and green.\n\nThe main subjects are two stylized, bright green frogs with wide, surprised eyes and open mouths, positioned in the lower half of the card, appearing to be levitating or jumping. They have thin black outlines and subtle highlights.\n\nAbove the frogs, dominating the upper portion of the card, is a classic flying saucer (UFO) with a metallic sheen, outlined in neon pink. A powerful beam of light, rendered with pink and blue gradient stripes and a grainy texture, emanates downwards from the UFO, illuminating the area around the text.\n\nThe text \"happy BIRTHDAY\" is prominently displayed in the center of the card, below the UFO and above the frogs. The words are in a pixelated, blocky font, with \"happy\" in a light green and \"BIRTHDAY\" in a brighter, almost electric green. There are subtle horizontal glitch effects on the text.\n\nThe background is a deep, dark blue night sky filled with small, scattered stars of various colors, including pink, light blue, and cyan, some with a starburst effect and others as simple dots. The composition is centered and symmetrical, with the UFO and its beam creating a strong vertical element that draws the eye down to the frogs and text.\n\nThe mood is playful, slightly chaotic, and humorous, evoking a sense of surprise and otherworldly fun, fitting for a funny card for a friend. There are no significant decorative patterns beyond the scattered stars and the light beam texture.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a funny greeting card with a digital art style. The background is a gradient of deep purple to dark blue, resembling a night sky. Scattered across the sky are numerous small white dots representing stars, and a few larger white stars with four-pointed flares. There are also subtle, faint diagonal lines of white dots, suggesting distant star trails or galaxies. Centered in the image, and slightly to the left, is a glowing, pixelated heart shape rendered in a vibrant, neon green. The heart emits a soft glow, and its pixelated construction is very distinct. There is no visible text or QR code. The overall composition focuses on the glowing heart against the starry sky, providing a visually simple yet impactful closure that echoes the likely visual theme of the card's front.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a vibrant, retro-futuristic digital glitch aesthetic. The artwork features a central slice of birthday cake with a lit candle, rendered in thick, bold black outlines and filled with bright, saturated colors like pink, yellow, and blue, with horizontal glitch lines of red and cyan distorting the cake. Surrounding the cake are multiple pop-up computer windows displaying error messages and warnings in a pixelated, 8-bit font. These include \"ERROR 404: CHILL NOT FOUND,\" \"WARNING: VIBE OVERLOAD,\" and \"ERROR\" with a red 'X' icon. Each window has a bright pink top bar and a light blue dialog box with a yellow \"OK\" button. The background is a grid of thin, glowing purple and pink lines, creating a sense of digital space or a warped cyberspace, with scattered confetti shapes (squares, triangles, rectangles) in various bright colors. To the left of the cake is a party popper exploding with streamers. To the right are two laughing emoji faces with tears, a larger one slightly above a smaller one, both rendered in a bold, cartoonish style with yellow fill and black outlines. Below these are two stylized skulls, also with thick black outlines and simple shading, one slightly larger than the other. At the bottom of the page is a representation of a computer control panel or keyboard, featuring colorful, blocky buttons and indicators. The overall color palette is a neon-infused blend of purples, pinks, blues, yellows, and accents of red and cyan, creating a high-contrast and energetic visual. The composition is dynamic, with elements spread across the page in a playful, slightly chaotic arrangement.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, retro-futuristic aesthetic. The background is a dark purple grid with glowing purple lines. Scattered across the background are various neon-colored, 8-bit-style icons: a bright orange smiley face with its tongue sticking out on the lower left, a blue \"thumbs up\" icon on the lower right, a glowing orange flame icon on the upper right, and a simple orange heart on the upper middle-left. There are also small, square neon pixels in orange, yellow, and blue dispersed around the scene.\n\nThe central focus is a large, rounded-corner rectangle, glowing with a bright pink neon outline. Inside this rectangle is the printed message in a playful, sans-serif font. The text is white and appears to be set against a slightly darker pink, semi-transparent background within the neon border, clearly delineating the message area. The message itself is casual and humorous. Below the message, aligned to the right, is the sender's name, \"- Jordan,\" also in white.\n\nThe design intentionally leaves ample blank space within the central message box for handwritten additions. The borders and decorative elements are stylized to evoke an old-school video game or digital interface, with strong neon glows and pixelated accents. The overall balance prioritizes the message area while incorporating eye-catching, thematic decoration."
