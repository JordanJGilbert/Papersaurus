    "frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card front, humorous and lighthearted. In the center, two cartoon characters highly resembling the people from reference photo 0e51a892-a08e-4bb6-ac97-33ba5cc4f57e are depicted from the waist up, side-by-side in their exact relative positions, clothing (with logos/text removed), hairstyles, facial features, and body proportions. The character on the left is enthusiastically presenting a ridiculously tiny, single-cupcake with one lit candle to the character on the right, who looks comically unimpressed and raises an eyebrow. The background is a simple, light wash of soft pastel colors with artistic paint splatters. In the center, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Sammy! Don't worry, we got you a fire extinguisher.\" The overall style is flat 2D for printing, with soft flowing colors, visible brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds characteristic of a watercolor painting.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
    "backCover": "A minimalist back cover for a greeting card. The background is a simple, very light wash of soft pastel colors with a few tiny, artistic paint splatters concentrated in the upper-left corner. The overall style is a flat 2D watercolor painting, featuring soft flowing colors, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The bottom-right area is clear of any decoration, remaining plain for logo or code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "The left interior panel of a greeting card. A subtle and artistic full-bleed background in a watercolor painting style. Soft pastel colors wash across the page, with a gentle cascade of small, abstract paint splatters and organic paint bleeds gracefully flowing from the top-left corner towards the center, creating a delicate decorative accent. The style is flat 2D for printing, with visible brush strokes and a soft paper texture throughout.",
    "rightInterior": "The right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to beautifully frame a written message. A full-bleed background with a very pale, soft pastel watercolor wash. Minimalist decorative elements, consisting of a few small, elegant paint splatters, are tucked into the top-right and bottom-left corners, leaving the main central area clear and open for text. The artwork is in a flat 2D watercolor style with visible paper texture and soft, organic bleeds.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my favorite person, Sammy,\n\nHappy Birthday! You're officially one year older, which means you're now slightly wiser, definitely more distinguished, and one step closer to stealing all the blankets with the authority of a seasoned pro. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nAll my love,\nJohn\""
