    "frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous watercolor greeting card front. In the center, a charming, slightly frazzled cartoon giraffe is tangled up in a ridiculously long, colorful birthday banner that it's trying to hang. The giraffe has a comical expression of mild panic and surprise, with one leg caught in the banner loops and its long neck twisted awkwardly. A small, cheeky bluebird is perched on the giraffe's head, holding the final letter of the banner in its beak. The scene is painted in a vibrant, soft-edged watercolor style with splashes and drips of color, creating a light and airy feel. Below the giraffe, in the safe center area, the words \"hope your birthday is anything but ordinary!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script in a dark teal ink. The background is a clean, simple off-white with subtle watercolor washes of pastel yellow and light blue, ensuring the focus is on the funny central illustration. Flat 2D artwork style for printing.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. The entire background is a solid off-white with a subtle, visible paper texture. In the top-left corner, there is a small, delicate arrangement of abstract watercolor splashes in pastel yellow, light blue, and a touch of vibrant teal, echoing the front cover's color palette. The splashes should be soft-edged with organic drips and bleeds. The design is very clean and sparse, occupying only the top-left quadrant, leaving the rest of the cover, especially the bottom-right corner, completely blank for branding or a QR code. Flat 2D artwork, watercolor painting style, high resolution."
