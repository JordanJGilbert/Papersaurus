    "frontCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a warm, light yellow watercolor wash background. The text \\\"Thank You!\\\" is prominently displayed in the upper center in a flowing, elegant, dark teal handwritten cursive script. Below the text, a thin, warm orange string is stretched horizontally across the mid-section. Hanging from this string are three stylized, cute cartoon cats: an orange tabby cat on the left, a Siamese cat in the center with one paw raised as if climbing, and a fluffy black cat on the right looking surprised. Interspersed between the cats and slightly behind them are soft, circular watercolor blobs in pastel shades of yellow, blue, and peach. At the bottom, a friendly, smiling golden retriever dog sits attentively, looking upwards at the cats with a joyful expression. The overall style is charming watercolor with visible brush strokes and soft paint bleeds, evoking a humorous and lighthearted mood. The composition is designed for a 9:16 ratio, with key elements kept away from the edges.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a soft, light yellow watercolor wash background, subtly referencing the front cover's color palette. In the upper center, a delicate, thin orange string element is present, reminiscent of the one on the front. Below the string, a single, small, round watercolor shape in a soft pastel color (like peach or light blue) is positioned. The rest of the background is a clean watercolor wash with minimal texture. The bottom right corner, approximately a 1-inch square, is completely clear and undecorated for a QR code. The focus is on a minimalist, serene, and subtly creative decorative design that provides a peaceful closure to the visual story, avoiding any text or characters.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card with a light yellow watercolor wash background, consistent with the front cover. This side features a playful scene where the three cats from the front cover are now engaged in a more dynamic and humorous activity. The orange tabby cat might be attempting to catch a dangling string, the Siamese cat could be mid-leap, and the black cat might be playfully batting at a floating watercolor bubble. The golden retriever from the front cover is visible in the lower section, perhaps peeking from behind a corner or lying down contentedly, observing the cats' antics with amusement. Soft, circular watercolor blobs in pastel shades of yellow, blue, and peach are scattered across the background, maintaining the visual continuity. The overall mood is lighthearted and whimsical, showcasing the ongoing playful interaction in a distinct watercolor style with soft brush strokes and organic paint bleeds. This side is entirely visual with no text.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card, designed to complement the left interior spread, featuring a light yellow watercolor wash background. This side is primarily a writing space, with decorative elements framing the message area. Elegant, flowing watercolor flourishes in soft teal and warm orange, echoing the colors of the text and string from the front cover, are placed along the edges and corners of the writing space. These flourishes are stylized and artistic, perhaps incorporating subtle leaf or swirl motifs within the watercolor style. The central area is kept clear and clean for handwritten messages. The decorative elements are designed to be unique and memorable, avoiding clichÃ©s and maintaining the charming, lighthearted watercolor aesthetic. No characters are present on this side, and the text \\\"\\[Blank space for handwritten message]\\\" is not visually depicted but is implied to be within the cleared writing space.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a delicate, whimsical watercolor style. The background is a soft, creamy off-white with subtle paper texture and gentle washes of pale yellow, evoking warmth and a serene atmosphere. Dominating the upper left portion of the image is a gracefully rendered, stylized golden-brown dog's tail, depicted in a sweeping curl. The tail exhibits soft, painterly strokes that mimic fur texture, with a dynamic, organic flow. Beneath the tail, towards the lower left, are a few small, scattered watercolor dots in muted pastel colors: a soft peach, a light blue-grey, and a pale yellow. These elements are intentionally sparse and understated, providing a peaceful, complementary conclusion to a potential narrative from the front and interior of the card. There is no text present, and the design is largely contained in the upper left, leaving the majority of the space clear. The composition is minimal and airy, with a reserved, artistic touch. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code, but the design elements are concentrated away from the lower right corner, implying a potential clearing for such a purpose.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a whimsical and humorous watercolor illustration. The scene depicts three cartoon-style cats in mid-air, tumbling and looking surprised, with their paws outstretched in a playful manner. An orange tabby cat with wide, expressive eyes is at the top, falling slightly to the right. Below and to the left is a grey tabby cat with a similar astonished expression. At the bottom right, another orange tabby cat is also mid-fall, with its body contorted. The cats are surrounded by colorful watercolor splashes and translucent, iridescent bubbles, suggesting a chaotic and joyous moment. The background is a light, textured cream color, with subtle watercolor washes and splatters in warm hues of orange, yellow, blue, and pink, creating a vibrant yet soft atmosphere. The overall artistic style is that of loose, expressive watercolor painting, with visible brush strokes and organic paint bleeds, contributing to the lighthearted and dynamic feel. There is no text present on this page, leaving ample space for a handwritten message.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a warm, creamy yellow watercolor wash background. The left side of the page features the head and shoulders of a friendly golden retriever, painted in soft watercolor strokes, with its head turned slightly to the right, looking into the blank space. Delicate, pale yellow botanical swirls and leaves frame the bottom left and right edges, extending upwards, creating a subtle, organic border. The top of the page is adorned with the curved tails of cats â€“ an orange tabby tail, a dark grey tail, and another brown and black striped tail â€“ also rendered in a watercolor style, suggesting they are positioned above. The central area is a large, open space for a handwritten message. In the bottom right quadrant of this blank space, the name \"Alex\" is elegantly written in a deep teal, flowing cursive script, with \"From: Alex\" written in a smaller, complementary font directly below it. The overall impression is one of gentle whimsy and warmth, with ample room for personal sentiment."
