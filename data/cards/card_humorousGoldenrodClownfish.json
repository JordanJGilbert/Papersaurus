    "frontCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The artwork features a large, ancient tree with intricate, gnarled roots spreading across the lower portion of the image. The tree's canopy is lush and detailed, with glowing golden leaves and subtle golden light radiating outwards. Above the tree, a complex, luminous geometric mandala-like pattern is rendered in shimmering gold, resembling a network of interconnected knowledge or ideas. The background transitions from a soft, warm, sandy hue near the horizon to a deep, rich, inky blue at the top, speckled with subtle golden dust or stars. The overall mood is inspirational and professional. Positioned at the bottom of the card, centered and safely within the printable area, are the words \\\"John Gilbert\\\" in a classic, elegant serif font, followed by \\\"AI FOR GOOD\\\" and \\\"JUNE 2025\\\" in a slightly smaller, clean sans-serif font.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style, continuing the theme from the front cover. The design is minimal and serene, featuring a subtle, abstract representation of radiating light or energy in soft golden hues, reminiscent of the illuminated pattern on the front. This abstract element is positioned towards the center-left of the card, avoiding the bottom-right corner which is left completely clear for a QR code. The background has a soft, muted watercolor wash, transitioning from a warm, pale ochre near the bottom to a slightly cooler, desaturated blue-grey towards the top, creating a sense of peaceful closure. The texture of watercolor paper is visible throughout, with gentle color variations and soft edges.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The artwork depicts a continuation of the 'AI For Good' theme, visually represented by a sprawling, organic network of glowing golden lines and nodes, similar to the geometric pattern on the front cover but more free-flowing and interconnected. This network spreads across the page, intertwining with subtle, soft-focus watercolor washes of warm golds, earthy browns, and muted blues. The overall impression is one of growth, connection, and flourishing ideas, evoking an inspirational and motivating tone. No people or characters are present. The composition should feel artistic and conceptually rich, hinting at the blossoming of thought and progress without being overly literal.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The focal point is the handwritten message, presented in an elegant, flowing cursive script with a natural, ink-like appearance. The text \\\"John,\\n\\nThank you for being a part of AI for Good this year. Your presence and insightful contributions truly helped to elevate the conversation and inspire new ways of thinking. We are so grateful for minds like yours that are actively shaping a brighter, more thoughtful future for everyone.\\n\\nWith sincere appreciation,\\nThe Vibecarding.com Team\\\" is artfully integrated into a decorative composition that echoes the themes from the front cover. Surrounding the text are delicate, abstract wisps of golden light and subtle, organic watercolor textures in warm earth tones and soft blues, creating an inspirational and uplifting atmosphere. The decorative elements are not floral or patterned in a traditional sense, but rather suggest the subtle blossoming of ideas and interconnectedness, complementing the handwritten message without overwhelming it. The entire spread maintains the consistent watercolor style, paper texture, and color palette, with the text safely positioned in the center area.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a subtle, serene, and artistic resolution to the visual story. The artistic style is a delicate watercolor painting with soft, muted colors and a gentle paper texture. The background is a soft, creamy off-white, with subtle washes of pale blue and grey creating a gentle gradient and a sense of depth, particularly around the lower left quadrant. The main visual element is a single, stylized stem with delicate, fine branches that ascend upwards and towards the right. These branches are depicted in a creamy white, almost luminescent, with tiny, subtle dots of white along their tips, resembling nascent buds or shimmering light particles. The base of this delicate stem emerges from a softly rendered, oval-shaped form in the lower left of the image. This form transitions from a soft, warm golden yellow at its upper part to a muted, dusty blue at its base, with a subtle, diffused shadow beneath it. The overall composition is minimal and elegant, leaving the majority of the space open and airy. The design focuses on the upper left and center-left areas, ensuring the bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is completely clear and undecorated to accommodate a QR code. There is no text or figurative imagery, maintaining a peaceful and contemplative conclusion that echoes the gentle, organic aesthetic established in earlier parts of the card. The watercolor brushstrokes are visible but soft, contributing to an overall feeling of quiet growth and subtle luminescence, providing a complementary and calming ending.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The background is a deep, rich teal blue, blended with lighter washes of turquoise and hints of a soft, pale yellow in the center. Overlaying this watercolor wash is an intricate network of branching, vein-like lines rendered in a luminous, metallic gold. These golden lines spread organically from the center outwards, creating a pattern reminiscent of a tree's root system, a neural network, or the branching veins of a leaf. The texture of the watercolor paper is subtly visible. Centered within this abstract, organic design is the quote: \"The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.\" The text is presented in a flowing, elegant black cursive script with subtle variations in line weight, giving it a handwritten feel. The composition is balanced, with the text clearly legible against the textured, abstract background, and the golden network of lines subtly framing the words without overpowering them. The overall mood is inspirational, intellectual, and visually captivating, reflecting the theme of expanding thought and new ideas.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a thank-you card designed for message space with a delicate watercolor wash background in soft, muted teal and cream tones. A stylized golden tree branch, with subtle shimmering golden speckles emanating from its tips, reaches down from the upper left corner. The main message is presented in an elegant, flowing cursive script in a warm, dark sepia ink. The text is well-spaced and centered, filling the majority of the right side of the card. The handwriting is legible, with a natural, slightly varied line weight, giving it a personal and warm feel. The overall aesthetic is sophisticated and uplifting, with no decorative borders or frames, allowing the natural beauty of the watercolor and the handwritten message to be the primary focus. The composition intentionally leaves ample white space around the text to ensure readability and a sense of calm."
