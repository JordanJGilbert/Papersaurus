    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor painting of a young East Asian couple taking a funny, distorted selfie, perfect for a birthday card front cover. The man is in the upper right, his face close to the camera with a huge, wide-eyed, goofy grin, he has short black textured hair and wears a solid maroon t-shirt. The woman is in the lower left, looking up at the camera with a happy, amused smile, she has shoulder-length dark brown hair and wears round glasses and a light yellow floral top. The perspective is a fisheye selfie lens effect, exaggerating their features for comedic effect. The background is a simple, soft wash of pastel colors. In the center, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The entire image is in a flat 2D watercolor style, with soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds along the edges. --ar 5:7 --seed 2024 --v 6.0 --style raw\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",

    "rightInterior": "A minimal decorative watercolor element in the bottom right corner, featuring a simple, abstract splash of soft maroon and light yellow.
