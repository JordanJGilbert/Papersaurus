    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 ratio, in a watercolor painting style. The scene depicts a young woman with dark hair, eyes closed and a serene expression, floating in vibrant aqua water. Above her, in the starry night sky, a constellation forms a delicate heart shape. Below the waterline, the scene transitions to an underwater view featuring a diverse coral reef with colorful coral formations. Several small, brightly colored fish swim amongst the coral. A majestic sea turtle glides gracefully through the water. In the background, stylized representations of iconic New York City skyscrapers emerge from the underwater landscape, rendered in warm, golden-orange tones. The word \"Congratulations\" is written in elegant, flowing white cursive script across the center of the card, positioned safely away from the top and bottom edges. The overall mood is magical, uplifting, and heartfelt, with a consistent color palette of deep blues, vibrant aquas, warm oranges, and touches of coral pink. Artistic brush strokes and subtle paper texture are visible throughout, creating an organic and inviting feel.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a serene watercolor painting of a tranquil beach scene at twilight. The top two-thirds of the image features a gradient sky transitioning from a soft lavender at the horizon to a deep, calming blue at the top. Scattered across the sky are delicate, twinkling stars of various sizes, with a prominent, gently glowing outline of a heart formed by sparkling, luminous dots positioned in the upper center. The bottom third depicts a calm, aqua ocean with gentle, foamy waves lapping onto a soft, sandy beach. Two stylized, pale yellow starfish rest on the sand in the lower right quadrant, peeking out from the edge of the incoming wave. The overall impression is peaceful, dreamy, and subtly uplifting, echoing the starry night and sparkling heart from the front of the card. The composition is clean and uncluttered, with the bottom right corner intentionally left clear to accommodate a QR code, focusing decorative elements towards the center and left. The watercolor style features soft washes, visible paper texture, and gentle paint bleeds, maintaining a consistent artistic feel with the rest of the card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The composition is split diagonally by a shimmering, curved golden line. The left side of the image depicts a deep, starry night sky in shades of indigo and deep blue, with scattered white and gold stars, some with a soft glow. Faint outlines of a suspension bridge, rendered in a pale, chalky white, are visible against this dark background. The right side of the image transitions into a bright, ethereal aqua and teal ocean, with subtle hints of white clouds or mist near the bottom. Multiple, faint outlines of the same suspension bridge design are layered across the aqua background, appearing as if reflected or distant. The overall effect is dreamy and evocative, symbolizing navigation and transition between different realms or experiences. The watercolor texture is evident throughout, with soft color bleeds and organic brush strokes, creating a rich, textured surface. The color palette is dominated by blues, teals, and white, with the striking accent of the golden curve.",

The message \"Mele Sing your true song Travel with your heart Trust your heart\" is written in elegant, flowing cursive handwriting with a dark brown ink, positioned in the upper center of the page, with ample clear space above and around it. Below the text, a charming composition of five stylized sea turtles are depicted. These turtles are a deep, rich blue, adorned with subtle gold constellations and scattered stars on their shells. They are presented as if floating upwards on thin, ethereal stalks, with a few faint blue leaves peeking from the bottom edge. The overall aesthetic is artistic, heartfelt, and inspiring, utilizing the watercolor painting style with soft, blended colors, visible brush strokes, and a textured paper feel. The design prioritizes readability of the message while integrating a unique and visually captivating illustration of celestial sea turtles, evoking a sense of wonder and personal guidance."
