    "frontCover": "A watercolor painting of a funny, cartoon-style illustration for a birthday card front. The scene features a cheerful, illustrated character of Carl, based on the reference photo, gleefully riding a comically oversized, majestic squirrel through a whimsical forest. The squirrel has a fluffy, exaggerated tail and is mid-gallop. Confetti and streamers float around them. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday Carl!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The artwork is a flat 2D illustration in a watercolor style, characterized by soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture background, and organic paint bleeds. The overall tone is humorous and lighthearted. --style raw\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",

I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered that I'm not that far behind you. Let's just agree we're both aging like fine wine... that's been left out on the counter a little too long.\n\nHope you have a great day!\n- Jordan\".
