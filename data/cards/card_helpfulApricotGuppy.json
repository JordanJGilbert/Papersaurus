The background is a wash of soft, celebratory huesâ€”blush pinks, warm golds, and gentle lavendersâ€”suggesting a beautiful shared history. Tiny, hand-painted flecks of gold leaf are scattered around them like shimmering memories, catching the light and adding a touch of magic to commemorate their twenty years together.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D cartoon illustration. The background is a solid, bright teal color. At the top, large, bold, black sans-serif text reads \"HAPPY 20th ANNIVERSARY\". The \"20th\" is in a bright yellow color. To the left and right of the main text, and scattered around the image, are small, stylized icons of screws, a bolt, and a wrench, all in black outline with occasional fill colors like white or light blue, contributing to a humorous, DIY-themed aesthetic.\n\nThe central focus is a cartoon depiction of a middle-aged couple. The woman on the left has blonde hair styled in a ponytail and is wearing an orange t-shirt. She has a cheerful expression and is holding open a small pamphlet or booklet with simple line-art illustrations of a figure and some symbols. She is looking towards the man. The man on the right is wearing a brown polo shirt and an orange baseball cap. He has headphones around his neck and a slightly confused or focused expression as he holds up a small Allen wrench.\n\nIn the foreground, on the bottom edge of the card, is an orange and yellow striped cat playing with a piece of black string. Beside the cat is a yellow tape measure, also with a humorous, slightly disheveled appearance. Scattered around the tape measure and cat are more of the small screw and bolt icons. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful, dominated by teal, orange, yellow, and brown, with black outlines defining the cartoon style.
