For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements.

Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm and whimsical watercolor illustration style. The scene depicts Teresa, transformed from her reference photo into a charming, illustrated character, joyfully stepping out of a classic, stately bank building (representing Chase) and into a lush, vibrant, sun-drenched landscape. Her business suit is playfully transforming into comfortable travel clothes mid-stride. In one hand, she's dropping a pair of old-school headphones (for her podcast), and in the other, she's eagerly holding a passport and a world map. The background is a soft-focus blend of iconic travel landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and a tropical beach, all painted in soft, flowing watercolors with a warm, golden-hour color palette. The entire illustration has a light, airy, and celebratory feel, with visible but delicate brushstrokes that convey a sense of handmade love and personal touch.\n\n2.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D cartoon illustration. The style is cheerful and vibrant with a limited color palette dominated by warm beige, navy blue, and pops of color from confetti and various objects. The main subject is a woman in a navy blue business suit, depicted in mid-air with a dynamic pose, suggesting excitement and freedom. She is holding a microphone in one hand and two passports in the other. Around her, colorful confetti is scattered, creating a celebratory atmosphere. To her left, there's a stylized representation of a bank vault with an eagle emblem and a treadmill with colorful weights, symbolizing her past career and active lifestyle. A green scarf with binary code patterns drapes behind her, hinting at her cybersecurity background. To her right, a tropical beach scene with a palm tree and the ocean under a yellow sky signifies her future travel plans. The text \"Congratulations ON YOUR Retirement!\" is prominently displayed in a stylish, flowing blue script across the lower half of the upper section. The background of this upper section is a soft, peachy-yellow color. The lower half of the card features a wooden paneled wall with a group of six cartoon characters standing together, looking towards the viewer with smiles. These characters appear to be a family or close friends, with diverse ages and appearances. The overall mood is joyful, humorous, and celebratory.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a retirement greeting card with a simple, innovative, and serene artistic closure. The overall artistic style is flat 2D illustration with subtle watercolor texture, maintaining a warm, golden-hour color palette consistent with the front cover. The composition features a cluster of stylized paper airplanes in the upper left quadrant, flying in a gentle arc towards the right. Descending from these airplanes is a stream of white binary code (0s and 1s), curving downwards and subtly transforming into more organic, travel-related motifs like passport stamps or abstract map lines as it approaches the bottom. The bottom right corner (approximately 1 inch square) is deliberately left completely clear and undecorated, providing ample space for a QR code. The rest of the background is a soft, peachy-orange gradient. The design focuses on the transition from the digital (binary code) to the exploratory (travel motifs), offering a peaceful and symbolic conclusion to the visual narrative of new beginnings after a career.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card, in a stylized cartoon illustration style with a humorous and lighthearted tone. The scene depicts a towering pile of interconnected computer keyboards and mice, rendered in muted, earthy tones with subtle textural details. A pair of oversized orange headphones rests prominently on the peak of this technology mountain. Perched directly on top of the headphones is a single, upright blue passport with a golden globe emblem, bathed in a spotlight of warm, golden-orange light from an unseen source above. The overall aesthetic is flat 2D artwork with a full-bleed background of a gradient sky, shifting from a warm yellow at the top to a soft orange at the bottom, suggesting a sunset or sunrise. The composition is tight, focusing on the symbolic pile of work items giving way to the passport, implying the transition from a career in cybersecurity to travel. The art style is clean and graphic, with bold outlines defining the objects and a subtle grain texture applied to the entire image to enhance the printed card feel. There is no text on this page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a retirement greeting card designed for message space with a vintage, sepia-toned aesthetic. The background is a parchment-like texture, with a warm, slightly aged feel. Delicate, hand-drawn line art flourishes frame the central text area. On the left side, a vintage-style microphone is depicted, emerging from a curling vine with small leaves and blossoms, and subtly incorporates passport stamps and a small airplane motif, hinting at travel. On the right side, the vine continues to elegantly arch and frame the upper portion of the message space. The message itself is presented in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script, in a dark, rich ink color. The typography is elegant, legible, and has a natural, personal touch, suggesting a high-quality pen. The design prioritizes ample, clear space for the message, with the decorative elements thoughtfully placed to enhance, not overwhelm, the text. The overall color palette is muted and warm, with shades of beige, brown, and black for the line art and text, all contained within a ornate, slightly distressed gold frame."
