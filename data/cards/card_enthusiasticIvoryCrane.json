    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D cartoon illustration. The art style is reminiscent of modern animation with bold outlines and a limited, warm color palette. The background features a stylized sky with fluffy, light blue clouds and a bright, yellow sun with radiating lines, all set against a light beige backdrop that extends to the edges, creating a full-bleed effect. In the foreground, there are two cartoon characters, a woman and a man, positioned in the center of the card, with their faces and upper bodies visible.\n\nThe woman on the left has short, wavy, reddish-brown hair, large round glasses with black frames, and a friendly, slightly smiling expression. She is wearing a chunky, grey knit sweater with a textured, cream-colored pattern resembling a fluffy cloud or sheep's wool, and a dark grey turtleneck underneath. Her lower body is obscured by the frame.\n\nThe man on the right has short, dark brown hair, wears black-rimmed glasses, and has a wide, cheerful smile. He is dressed in a dark grey polo shirt, a green bomber jacket, and blue shorts. His posture is relaxed, with one hand slightly in his pocket.\n\nBehind the characters, on the left, is a simplified illustration of an orange building with two dark rectangular windows, suggesting a house or structure. On the right, another simplified orange building is partially visible, with a dark rectangular window. Green bushes or trees are subtly depicted between the buildings and the characters.\n\nThe text \"SUNNY DAY\" is prominently displayed in large, bold, uppercase, sans-serif letters across the top of the card, colored in a vibrant orange. The text is centered and positioned safely away from the top edge. The overall mood is lighthearted, cheerful, and evokes a feeling of a pleasant, everyday scene. The composition is balanced, with the characters as the focal point and the background elements providing context without being distracting. The colors are flat and saturated, contributing to the clean, modern cartoon aesthetic.",

The style is a warm and playful gouache and colored pencil character illustration with a 9:16 aspect ratio. The scene is vibrant and full of life, centered on a charmingly exaggerated, muscular cartoon character representing Mau.

This section focuses on visual storytelling development. The scene depicts an empty, stylized gym rack, subtly colored in a darker grey than the barbell on the front cover, and positioned slightly off-center to the left.

Another year stronger... now go have a cheat day, you've earned it!\n\nYours,\nMeiling' written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that looks like elegant, warm penmanship with slight variations in line weight. The handwriting is strategically placed and artfully framed by subtle, abstract shapes in soft, desaturated pink and yellow hues that mimic the frosting and cake layers from the front cover, creating an artistic, non-clichÃ© border without featuring any people or direct objects. These abstract shapes are blended into the background colors. The overall feeling is joyful, personal, and celebratory.
