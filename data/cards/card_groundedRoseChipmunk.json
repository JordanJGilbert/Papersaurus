    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. The background is a soft, textured watercolor paper in a pale golden-pink wash, created with flat 2D artwork. In the top-left corner, there is a very small, delicate watercolor illustration of a single blooming red rose with a short stem and a couple of green leaves. The artwork features soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. The design is simple and sparse, covering only about 15% of the surface, leaving the majority of the background clear, especially the bottom-right corner.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and subtle decorative panel for the left interior of a greeting card. A flat 2D watercolor illustration on a textured paper background with a soft, warm sunset gradient of pink, orange, and gold. A delicate cascade of ethereal watercolor hearts and small, blooming red roses with green leaves floats down from the top-left corner towards the center, covering about 35% of the panel. The illustration uses soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds to create a romantic and dreamy atmosphere. The design is purely decorative with no text.",
    "rightInterior": "An elegant and minimalist design for the right interior panel of a greeting card, focusing on the message. The background is a flat 2D watercolor wash on textured paper, transitioning from a very light, soft pink at the top to a pale gold at the bottom. A tiny, single blooming red watercolor rose is placed in the bottom-left corner, and a small, delicate ethereal watercolor heart is in the top-right corner. These elements are subtle, created with soft flowing colors and artistic brush strokes, occupying no more than 15% of the space to ensure the central area is clear and legible for the main text."
