    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a flat, 2D cartoon illustration style. The background is a solid, soft sky blue. Bold, dark brown, sans-serif text reads \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" stacked in the upper portion of the card, positioned centrally and safely away from the top and bottom edges. To the left of the text, a light brown paper bag labeled \"FLOUR\" is depicted, tipped over and spilling a puff of white powder. Beneath the flour bag, a carton of three eggs is shown, with one egg precariously balanced on top of the carton. Next to the eggs, a blue mixing bowl sits inside a larger orange bowl, with a yellow pat of butter leaning against the side of the mixing bowl. To the right of the baking ingredients, a cartoon fox character wearing a white chef's hat is shown. The fox has wide, anxious eyes, furrowed eyebrows, and a worried expression, with sweat droplets around its head, conveying a humorous sense of panic. Its paws are clasped together in front of its chest. The fox's body is predominantly orange with white accents on its chest, muzzle, and tail tip. The overall mood is lighthearted and humorous, hinting at a baking mishap. The art style is clean, simple, and friendly, with thick outlines and flat colors, making it suitable for printing.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a humorous birthday greeting card, flat 2D artwork, full-bleed. The style is clean, minimalist, and uses bold, flat colors with subtle textures reminiscent of digital illustration. The background is a solid, muted sky blue. Positioned in the bottom right quadrant of the image is a simple, stylized cupcake. The cupcake has a beige wrapper with vertical brown lines, a generous swirl of white frosting, and a single, thin orange birthday candle with a yellow flame at the very top. The cupcake is slightly offset to the right, with a subtle shadow cast beneath it. Floating in the upper left quadrant of the image is a white, slightly crinkled piece of paper representing a store receipt. It has a jagged bottom edge and features the word \"RECEIPT\" in bold black sans-serif capital letters at the top. Below the word are several black horizontal lines of varying lengths, simulating receipt text. There is no text integrated into the artwork itself, and no explicit space reserved for QR codes. The overall composition is clean and open, creating a sense of whimsical simplicity that complements the humorous message of the card. The colors are bright but not overwhelming, and the minimalist design allows the iconic elements of the cupcake and receipt to stand out.",
