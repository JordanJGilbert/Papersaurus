    "frontCover": "a humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover featuring cartoon illustrated versions of the specific people from image 840bea95-bfa4-4de2-8c0d-5430b70ec529, capturing their unique features, hair, and clothing styles. The characters are depicted in a funny, exaggerated pose, perhaps one is playfully trying to steal a piece of a giant birthday cake from the other, with mischievous expressions on their faces. The text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, positioned in the center. The entire scene is a flat 2D artwork in a vibrant watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds on a clean white background. --ar 5:7\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
    "backCover": "A very minimal and elegant design for the back of a greeting card, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear. A single, small, isolated watercolor splotch in a vibrant, soft flowing color, with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds at the top center. The design is a flat 2D artwork on a clean white background, creating a simple, artistic brand mark. The overall aesthetic is clean and minimalist, with about 80% negative space. --ar 5:7",
    "leftInterior": "A subtle and artistic design for the left interior of a greeting card. A beautiful, decorative border composed of abstract watercolor splashes and soft flowing paint bleeds along the left edge of the panel. The colors are vibrant yet gentle, echoing the palette of a festive birthday cake and confetti. The artwork is in a flat 2D watercolor painting style with visible paper texture and artistic brush strokes on a clean white background. This design is purely decorative, containing no text or central figures, and covers about 40% of the page, leaving ample white space. --ar 5:7",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist and elegant design for the right interior of a greeting card, created to beautifully frame a written message. A simple, light watercolor wash forms a subtle, textured background in the center of the panel, leaving a clean white border around the edges. Two small, delicate watercolor splotches are placed in the top-left and bottom-right corners of this central area, adding a touch of vibrant color. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The design is very sparse, with about 80% of the space intentionally left clear for text. --ar 5:7"
