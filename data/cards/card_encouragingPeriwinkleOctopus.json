Just kidding! Mostly. Hope you have a fantastic birthday!\n\n- Jordan\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1.

BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

    "frontCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a minimalist, flat 2D illustration. The background is a soft, creamy off-white. At the top center, in bold, black sans-serif font, is the text \\\"Happy Birthday\\\". The main visual is a stylized, stick-figure person with a simple round head, dot eyes, and a subtle smile, shown in profile from the waist up. This figure is interacting with a Rube Goldberg-esque machine composed of geometric shapes and gears. The machine features bold black outlines. Key elements include: a large blue sphere on the left, which the figure's left hand is near; several interconnected gears in red, blue, and yellow, with the figure's right hand placing a red gear. Other elements include yellow triangles, blue squares, thin black connecting lines, and red and orange circles. The composition is dynamic and asymmetrical, with the machine extending diagonally across the card. The overall mood is playful, slightly abstract, and subtly humorous, suggesting a whimsical, mechanical celebration.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a minimalist, flat 2D illustration. The background is a soft, creamy off-white, matching the front. The design features a subtle continuation of the geometric and mechanical theme from the front. A single, smaller blue gear is prominently placed on the left side, connected by a thin black line to a small yellow triangle on the right. A thin black line also extends from the bottom left corner upwards, subtly echoing the diagonal lines from the front. A small blue square is positioned near the yellow triangle. The overall composition is sparse and serene, providing a quiet, artistic conclusion without text or figures, and subtly referencing the visual elements of the front cover.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card with a minimalist, flat 2D illustration. The background is a soft, creamy off-white. The scene depicts a continuation of the mechanical theme. The stick-figure person from the front is now shown from the knees up, still interacting with the machine, but with a slightly different pose, perhaps adjusting a blue gear. The machine is more elaborate here, with more interconnected gears (blue, red, yellow) and geometric shapes (yellow triangles, blue squares, red circles). Lines connect various components, suggesting movement and process. The composition is more dense than the front cover, with the machine filling a larger portion of the space. The color palette remains consistent with bold black outlines and the primary colors blue, red, yellow, and orange. The mood is still playful and humorous, emphasizing the intricate and slightly absurd nature of the birthday contraption.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card with a minimalist, flat 2D illustration. The background is a soft, creamy off-white. The central area is occupied by the text: \\\"Craig,\\n\\nI was going to write a long, elaborate message, but this is a simple card, and you're a simple guy. Just kidding! Mostly. Hope you have a fantastic birthday!\\n\\n- Jordan\\\". The text is in a clear, readable black sans-serif font, centered within the safe printing area. The text is integrated into a decorative framework that continues the mechanical and geometric theme. This framework includes bold black outlines forming abstract shapes that subtly mimic gears and connecting rods, possibly framing the text on the sides or bottom. A few small, stylized elements like a yellow triangle or a blue gear might be subtly placed around the text to enhance the decorative effect without overwhelming the message. The color palette is consistent with the front cover: blue, red, yellow, and orange accents against the black outlines and off-white background. The tone remains lighthearted and humorous, with the visual design complementing the witty message.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card, flat 2D artwork for printing, full-bleed background, no text or people. The style is inspired by Bauhaus and mid-century modernism, featuring a playful arrangement of bold, geometric shapes in primary colors: red circles and triangles, blue squares and triangles, and yellow squares and triangles. The shapes are organized in a balanced, slightly off-kilter composition, evoking a sense of organized chaos and childlike wonder. The background is a subtle, creamy off-white, creating a soft contrast that allows the vibrant shapes to pop. The arrangement of shapes subtly echoes the playful, building-block nature of the front and interior designs, providing a satisfying, minimalist conclusion to the visual narrative. There is ample blank space on the back cover, suitable for adding a small brand logo or QR code if needed, while maintaining the clean, artistic aesthetic. The overall feeling is cheerful, simple, and sophisticated, a fitting resolution to a lighthearted birthday message.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a split composition. The left side features a crudely drawn, minimalist stick figure with a sad face, holding a single, small object that resembles a matchstick. The figure is rendered in a simple, bold black outline against a plain, light background. The right side depicts a simplified interior scene with a minimalist aesthetic. A table with a small box on it stands centrally, with a framed square on the wall behind it. A door with a simple handle is visible to the right, and a pendant light hangs from the ceiling. The entire image uses a flat, 2D graphic style with a limited, muted color palette of off-white and black, maintaining a consistent, stark, and humorous tone.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a cream-colored, full-bleed background. The primary design element is the printed message, \"CRAIG, I WAS GOING TO WRITE A LONG, ELABORATE MESSAGE, BUT THIS IS A SIMPLE CARD, AND YOU'RE A SIMPLE GUY. JUST KIDDING! MOSTLY. HOPE YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC BIRTHDAY! JORDAN\" rendered in a bold, slightly uneven, hand-drawn black sans-serif font. This text occupies the upper two-thirds of the page, with ample white space around it to allow for a handwritten personal message. To the right of the message, a large, simple blue birthday candle stands vertically, its top edge reaching just below the text and its base extending towards the bottom edge of the card. The candle has a simple yellow flame at its tip, depicted as a teardrop shape. Below the printed signature \"JORDAN,\" a minimalist stick figure character, in black outline with a circular head, is positioned to the left. This character is holding a tiny yellow flame, mirroring the candle's flame and suggesting an act of lighting it. The overall artistic style is flat 2D illustration with a playful, humorous, and informal tone. The color palette is limited to cream, black, blue, and yellow, creating a clean and direct visual impact. No borders or extraneous decorative elements are present, emphasizing the message and the simple, humorous illustration."
