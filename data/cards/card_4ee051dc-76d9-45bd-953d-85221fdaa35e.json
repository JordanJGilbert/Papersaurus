    "backCover": "A simple, minimalist watercolor design bringing peaceful closure. A single, gracefully curved tree branch, identical to the one on the front cover, extends from the top left corner towards the center. A few scattered, colorful sprinkles lie on the branch, hinting at the cake's chaotic journey. The background is a serene, pale wash of the same light blue and yellow from the front cover, fading into the white paper texture. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated. The overall feeling is quiet, clean, and humorous in its subtlety. The style is a soft watercolor with organic paint bleeds and visible paper texture.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration of a charming, slightly frazzled cartoon sloth wearing a tiny party hat, hanging upside down from a tree branch. It's struggling to hold a giant, elaborately decorated birthday cake that's tilting precariously. A few sprinkles and a dollop of frosting are already falling off. The sloth has a wide-eyed, comical expression of determination. The background is a soft wash of light blue and sunny yellow, suggesting a cheerful day. In the center, below the branch, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is a whimsical watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background.",
    "leftInterior": "An artistic and humorous watercolor scene showing the aftermath of the cake incident. The entire page is a beautiful, abstract mess of colorful frosting splatters, sprinkles, and cake crumbs against a pale background. It's not chaotic, but rather an aesthetically pleasing composition of splats, drips, and smears in pastel pinks, blues, and yellows, rendered with artistic watercolor techniques. One lone, slightly squashed party hat sits in the middle of the 'mess,' a funny and silent testament to the story. The style is a beautiful, abstract watercolor with soft flowing colors, visible brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "Elegant watercolor artwork framing a central message space. The message \"To Audrey, Wishing you a birthday that\u2019s anything but slow! With love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. This text is centered. Whimsical, light green watercolor vines, matching the leaves from the front cover's branch, gracefully swirl around the edges of the page, creating a delicate, organic border. Interspersed among the vines are a few colorful, stray sprinkles, visually tying it to the left page and front cover. The background is a clean, soft off-white with subtle watercolor paper texture, making the text and illustrations pop."
