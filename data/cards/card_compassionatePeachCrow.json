    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a flat 2D illustrated style, featuring a light cream background. The artwork is characterized by bold, clean lines and a limited, cheerful color palette. In the upper portion, a stylized building resembling a bell tower with a red dome is depicted, flanked by two palm trees on the left. A bright yellow sun-like shape with interconnected nodes, reminiscent of a neural network, is in the upper right. A curved banner of orange and pink, filled with binary code (01010101), flows from the building towards the sun. On the left, a sad, turquoise robot with its hand on its head is positioned. On the right, a woman with dark hair and glasses, wearing a magenta shirt, smiles and points towards the binary code. The central text, \"THANK YOU - AI FOR GOOD CONFERENCE\", is displayed prominently in bold, pink and teal sans-serif font, with the \"THANK YOU -\" in pink and \"AI FOR GOOD CONFERENCE\" in teal. The bottom section features two male characters. On the left, an older man with glasses and a green cap holds a piece of paper. On the right, a younger man with dark curly hair wears a dark teal t-shirt with \"ISLAND OF SICILIA ITALIA\" printed on it. Lush green stylized trees and bushes form the background for the lower characters, with small yellow dashes representing a path or ground. The overall mood is friendly, slightly humorous, and celebratory, with a clear visual narrative of technological advancement and human collaboration.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist, tech-inspired theme. The background is a deep teal with a subtle, repeating pattern of faint, illuminated binary code (0s and 1s) arranged in vertical streams. The dominant visual element is a stylized, classic incandescent light bulb, rendered in a warm, soft yellow gradient. Inside the glass bulb, the letters \"IDEAS\" are displayed, with each letter in a separate, textured green tile, reminiscent of old computer keycaps. The light bulb is positioned centrally, with its base slightly cropped at the bottom. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and conceptually linked to innovation and artificial intelligence, providing a simple yet memorable conclusion to a visual narrative. The style is flat 2D illustration with a subtle gradient effect on the light bulb and a faint glow emanating from it, against the flat background. There is no text other than within the lightbulb, and no visible space reserved for QR codes.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dynamic, interconnected network design. The background is a deep teal, textured with a subtle gradient, suggesting depth. Winding lines in vibrant teal, pink, and mustard yellow form a complex web, connecting circular nodes of varying sizes and shades of pink, teal, and yellow. Scattered throughout the network are stylized, flat illustrations of pink brain icons, symbolizing intelligence and thought. Prominent amongst these are bright, yellow lightbulbs with radiating lines, signifying ideas and innovation. There are also subtle inclusions of binary code, represented by white numbers \"1\" and \"0\" integrated into the lines, and a small, green recycling symbol. A tiny, yellow bird with teal wings is perched on one of the connecting lines. The overall style is modern, graphic, and minimalist, with a bold color palette that creates a visually engaging and slightly abstract representation of connectivity and progress. There is no text present on this page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with the following elements: A playful, oversized speech bubble, outlined in a thick, vibrant pink and a thinner black line, contains the printed message. The speech bubble has a cream-colored interior that serves as the primary area for handwritten messages. The text \"Jessica, Thanks for joining us at the AI for Good Conference! It was great to see so many brilliant minds focused on creating a better future, and not just teaching robots to be better at Wordle than us. We're so glad you were part of it!\" is displayed in a clean, modern, sans-serif font within this cream-colored area. The background of the entire page is a continuous, stylized digital pattern. This pattern features a bright teal color base with a subtle, faint overlay of binary code (0s and 1s) and interconnected nodes with thin white lines, resembling a network. Scattered across this digital background are two glowing lightbulb icons, depicted in a simple, stylized illustration. These lightbulbs are bright yellow with radiating lines and a teal base, emitting a soft yellow glow. The overall artistic style is flat 2D graphic design with a touch of whimsy. The composition is balanced, with the speech bubble prominently featured in the center, leaving ample space within for personalization. The color palette consists of bright teal, vibrant pink, cream, black, and yellow. The design evokes a sense of intellect and innovation with a lighthearted, humorous tone."
