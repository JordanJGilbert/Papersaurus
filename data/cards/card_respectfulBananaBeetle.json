Avoid generic or clichÃ© designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"congrats on graduating berkeley!\"\nStyle: âœ¨ Smart Style\nTone: ðŸ˜„ Funny - humorous and lighthearted\n\n\n\n\nReference: \"make a cartoon of us\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards.

Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"graduation\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm, painterly gouache and watercolor illustration. The style captures the iconic Sather Tower and the surrounding Berkeley campus in a bright, sun-drenched light, with a soft, slightly dreamy focus. The colors are rich and celebratory, featuring Berkeley's classic blue and gold, but softened and blended with warm yellows, gentle greens, and touches of terracotta from the campus architecture. The line work is delicate and slightly imperfect, like a cherished memory sketched in a travel journal, giving it a personal, hand-touched feel. The overall effect is one of joyful nostalgia and bright optimism, celebrating a significant achievement with heartfelt, artistic warmth.\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in a warm, painterly gouache and watercolor illustration.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a vibrant, cartoonish illustration in a 2D flat art style. The color palette is dominated by a bright sky blue, with accents of Berkeley's signature blue and gold, alongside earthy greens and warm terracotta for buildings. The main subjects are two stylized cartoon characters, a male and a female, wearing graduation gowns and caps. They are joyfully depicted mid-air, riding on a spring that has erupted from an open book labeled \"PHYSICS.\" The character on the left is laughing exuberantly with eyes closed, while the character on the right has a surprised, wide-eyed expression. Scattered around them are various academic symbols like mathematical equations (E=mcÂ², Ï€, âˆšx), graduation caps, and paw prints, reinforcing the graduation theme. In the background, iconic Berkeley landmarks are visible: Sather Tower and buildings with the \"UC Berkeley\" signage. The overall mood is energetic, humorous, and celebratory, capturing the triumph of completing a challenging academic journey. The text \"CONGRATS ON SURVIVING BERKELEY!\" is prominently displayed at the top in a bold, white, sans-serif font with a thick black outline, perfectly centered and safely distanced from the edges.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a flat 2D cartoon illustration of a sleeping blue bird nestled inside a graduation cap. The background is a soft, pale yellow. The graduation cap is black with a dark gray tassel hanging from the side. Several small, stylized blades of grass in a muted green are depicted around the base of the cap. Three \"Zzz\" marks in black are shown above the bird, indicating sleep. The overall style is simple, charming, and humorous, with clean lines and a limited color palette. The composition is minimalist, with the main subject placed towards the bottom left, leaving ample negative space on the right and top. No text is present, and there is no specific area designated for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a graduation greeting card, 9:16 ratio, featuring a humorous and whimsical cartoon illustration in a flat 2D artistic style with a painterly texture. The scene depicts a plump, adorable blue bird with closed eyes and a content expression, nestled comfortably inside a black graduation cap. Three simple black \"Z\"s float above the bird, indicating it is fast asleep. The graduation cap has a black tassel hanging off the side and sits slightly tilted on a textured, pale yellow ground with sparse, sketched blades of grass. The background is a solid, soft, creamy yellow, creating a warm and gentle atmosphere. The artwork is clean, with simple, bold outlines around the bird and cap, and a subtle texture applied to the colored areas, reminiscent of gouache or a light watercolor wash. The overall tone is lighthearted and celebratory, conveying a sense of exhaustion after hard work and achievement, using a limited but harmonious color palette of soft blues, black, pale yellow, and a touch of yellow for the bird's bib. The composition places the main subject in the lower left quadrant, with ample negative space to the right, allowing for text to be added.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a dynamic, humorous illustration. The style is flat, 2D cartoon art with bold outlines and a vibrant, limited color palette of blues, yellows, and off-whites, reminiscent of the front cover's theme. The background features a clear, bright sky with stylized clouds. The central area is designed to be open for handwritten messages, with decorative elements strategically placed to frame this space without overwhelming it.\n\nOn the left side, a stylized, slightly whimsical depiction of Sather Tower (UC Berkeley's iconic campanile) rises from the ground, rendered in simple geometric shapes and bold outlines, with a few scattered academic symbols like Greek letters and mathematical equations (e.g., \"E=mcÂ²\") floating around it, mirroring motifs from the front cover.\n\nOn the right side, a graduation cap is depicted in mid-air, as if tossed upwards in celebration, with a subtle \"paw print\" motif nearby, referencing the school's mascot. The bottom edge of the page features a continuous winding path or road, similar to the one on the front cover, leading into the scene.\n\nThe overall composition is balanced, leaving ample white space in the center for personalization. The humor is conveyed through the exaggerated elements and the playful continuation of the academic theme. The art style is consistent with the front cover, maintaining the friendly, cartoonish aesthetic. There is no printed text on this interior page, ensuring maximum space for the recipient's personal message. The overall impression is one of cheerful, congratulatory energy that leaves room for heartfelt sentiment."
