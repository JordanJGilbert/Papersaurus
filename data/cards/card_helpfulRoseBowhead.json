    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a vibrant, dynamic, and cheerful digital art style. The color palette is dominated by bright yellows and oranges, creating a sunny and energetic atmosphere, with pops of teal, brown, and red. The main subjects are two stylized, cartoonish characters: a man with glasses and black spiky hair, wearing a black t-shirt and pants, triumphantly raising a clenched fist in the air, and a woman with long brown hair, wearing a teal tank top and black pants, smiling and holding onto a large axe with him. They are depicted in a dynamic pose, as if mid-action or celebration. Three small, round, brown characters with happy faces, resembling boba pearls, are scattered around the upper part of the image. In the lower right corner, a large boba tea cup is prominently featured, with a colorful striped straw (red, orange, blue) sticking out, and steam rising from the top. The text \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY DARIEN!\" is in a bold, sans-serif font with a yellow fill and a thick dark blue outline, placed in the lower left quadrant of the card, angled slightly. The background features radiating yellow lines originating from the center, adding to the energetic and celebratory feel. The overall mood is overwhelmingly joyful, playful, and celebratory.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a playful, cute, and simple cartoon style. The main subject is a large, stylized boba tea cup, rendered in warm orange, filled with black boba pearls. A creamy beige lid is topped with a matching straw. A small, cheerful boba pearl character with rosy cheeks and a friendly smile peeks out from behind the cup, waving one arm. The background is a solid, vibrant teal color, with a subtle beige horizontal line near the bottom representing a surface. The artistic style uses thick, consistent black outlines around all elements, giving it a bold, graphic feel. The colors are flat and saturated, with a subtle texture overlay adding a slightly retro or handcrafted quality. The composition is clean and centered, with the boba cup dominating the space. There is ample negative space in the teal background, suggesting a reserved area for potential text or a QR code, though none are present in this specific design. This back cover design provides a charming and humorous conclusion to the card's visual narrative, reinforcing the boba theme with a friendly, animated element.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a top-down perspective, depicting a whimsical and playful scene of a vortex or swirl filled with anthropomorphic boba pearls and sugar cubes. The boba pearls are small, round, dark brown characters with simple, cheerful smiley faces and stick-like arms and legs, all drawn in a thick, bold outline style. They are scattered throughout the image, some in clusters, some individually, and some appearing to be in motion, creating a dynamic and energetic feel. The central focus is a swirling pattern of rich purple liquid, with lighter, creamy brown streaks suggesting movement and creaminess. Within this swirl, a pile of light beige, perfectly cubed sugar cubes is stacked, adding a textural and conceptual contrast to the soft boba. The background is a warm gradient of deep pink and purple hues, intensifying towards the top and edges. The overall artistic style is reminiscent of modern illustration with clean lines and flat coloring, but with subtle cel-shading to give the boba and sugar cubes a sense of volume. The colors are harmonious and saturated, creating a vibrant and appealing visual. There is no visible text or typography in this specific artwork, allowing the illustration to convey the playful theme directly. The composition draws the viewer's eye into the swirling vortex, emphasizing the abundance of boba and the fun, energetic atmosphere, perfectly complementing the theme of a birthday for a boba lover.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a vibrant, stylized illustration of boba tea elements. The background is a rich, deep orange with a subtle textured pattern, resembling paper or canvas. Dominating the scene are fluid, organic shapes in shades of bright orange and yellow, evoking spilled boba tea or the swirls of liquid. These decorative elements wrap around the text area, with thick black outlines and a slightly distressed, retro aesthetic, perhaps influenced by screen printing. Small, dark circular details and occasional diamond shapes are interspersed within these fluid shapes, suggesting tapioca pearls and ice. The main text area is relatively clear, allowing for handwriting. The printed greeting \"Happy birthday, Darien!\" is presented in a flowing, elegant script font in a creamy white color, placed at the top left of the message space. The subsequent printed message, also in the same script font and color, is arranged in paragraphs, with generous line spacing to facilitate writing. The overall design balances the playful, decorative boba theme with ample, unobtrusive space for personalization, creating a warm and inviting feel."
