    "frontCover": "A whimsical, vintage-style 2D cartoon illustration for the front of a greeting card. The scene depicts a funny and chaotic memory from a Fourth of July trip to Great America amusement park.\n\nIn the foreground, two stylized cartoon characters, Jordan and Lao Lao, are drawn in a charming, classic children's book style based on the provided reference photo. They are seated side-by-side in the front car of a wildly exaggerated, old-fashioned wooden roller coaster. Jordan has a look of comical terror, eyes wide, hair flying straight back, while holding onto the safety bar for dear life. Lao Lao, in contrast, is laughing with pure joy, arms thrown up in the air, completely unfazed.\n\nThe background is a soft, dreamlike depiction of the amusement park at dusk, with the warm, nostalgic glow of fireworks exploding in the sky. The fireworks are stylized, resembling big, colorful dandelions. Whimsical details like a stray hot dog flying through the air and a tiny, mischievous squirrel wearing a miniature patriotic top hat on the roller coaster track add a humorous touch. The color palette is warm and faded, with soft reds, creamy whites, and dusky blues, evoking a timeless, fairy-tale aesthetic.\n\nCentered in the middle of the illustration, away from the top and bottom edges, the words \"Thank You\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The overall composition is a flat 2D artwork, perfect for printing, capturing a lighthearted and cherished personal moment.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.
