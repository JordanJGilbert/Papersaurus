    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a watercolor artistic style. The color palette is dominated by warm oranges and yellows, with hints of brown, blue, and green. The main subjects are two cartoonish, happy characters, a boy and a girl, energetically interacting with a giant cup of boba tea. The boy, wearing glasses and a black t-shirt, sits on the rim of the cup, holding a large red and white striped straw with the girl. The girl, with long brown hair and wearing a blue sleeveless top, is reaching up to help him with the straw, her expression full of joy. The giant boba cup is filled with a creamy liquid and many dark brown boba pearls, and is overflowing with frothy foam and splashes. The background features a stylized sky with fluffy clouds in shades of orange and yellow, and a grassy green foreground. Scattered around the scene are dark brown boba pearls, some appearing to float in the air. The text \"Happy Birthday, Darien!\" is written in a playful, calligraphic script in a dark brown color, positioned in the upper right portion of the card, above the characters and boba cup. The overall mood is joyful, energetic, and celebratory.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a whimsical, illustrative watercolor style. The scene depicts a large, clear plastic boba tea cup with a translucent straw, placed outdoors on a patch of slightly damp grass under a deep indigo night sky. A single, glowing, pale yellow tapioca pearl sits to the right of the cup, casting a soft, warm light onto the grass and the base of the cup. Tiny, scattered white stars dot the night sky, with one slightly larger plus-sign-shaped star visible towards the top left. The background features a soft, hazy silhouette of distant trees or bushes along the horizon line, rendered in darker blues and greens. The overall impression is peaceful, slightly magical, and directly complements the boba theme from the front of the card, providing a sense of quiet enjoyment of the treat. No visible space is reserved for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a charming watercolor illustration of a large boba tea cup. The artwork features a clear, slightly textured glass filled with layers of boba tea. The boba pearls are anthropomorphized as small, cute, round creatures with simple dot eyes and wide, smiling mouths, rendered in a warm brown color. They are depicted floating and migrating throughout the drink. The bottom layer of the drink has a frothy, bubbly texture labeled \"Sea of Sweetness (bubbles)\" in delicate, hand-lettered typography. Above this, the liquid is a golden-brown color. The top of the drink is crowned with a generous amount of fluffy white milk foam, artistically rendered with visible brush strokes and texture, labeled \"Wispy Cloud Kingdom\" with a smaller label \"milk foam.\" A green and white striped straw juts out from the top left of the cup. The overall artistic style is whimsical, gentle, and reminiscent of children's book illustrations or traditional watercolor techniques, with a warm, inviting color palette dominated by creamy whites, golden browns, and a touch of green. The composition is centered around the boba cup, with text labels strategically placed to guide the viewer's eye through the whimsical depiction of the drink's elements. The style and elements perfectly complement the theme of a birthday card for someone who loves boba.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a whimsical watercolor background of swirling pastel colors, predominantly warm yellows and soft teals. The background is artfully decorated with numerous dark brown, glossy, spherical elements resembling tapioca pearls, scattered around the edges and curving inwards, creating an organic, bubbly border. The central area is left largely blank for a handwritten message, but features printed text in a charming, flowing script font that reads \"Happy birthday, Darien!\" and then a longer birthday wish. The overall style is loose and painterly, with soft edges and a textured feel, suggesting a handmade watercolor illustration. The design balances the decorative elements of the boba pearls and watercolor swirls with ample, clear space for personalization."
