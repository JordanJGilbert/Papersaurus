    "frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a funny and charming watercolor painting of Jordan from the reference photo trying to do a yoga warrior pose in a park. His dog Milo, also from the reference photo, is playfully mimicking the pose right beside him, looking very proud. Jordan has a look of comical concentration, slightly off-balance. They are surrounded by a whimsical, soft-focus background of green grass and trees. Floating around them are colorful, translucent watercolor splotches like confetti. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\". The art style is flat 2D, with soft bleeding edges and a lighthearted, illustrative feel.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "Elegant and minimalist greeting card back cover. A soft, off-white watercolor paper texture background with a single, small, whimsical watercolor splotch in a vibrant teal color, positioned in the top-left quadrant. The splotch has soft bleeding edges and artistic paint splatter details, echoing the style of the front cover. The design is simple, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. The overall aesthetic is clean and artistic. Flat 2D for printing.",
    "leftInterior": "Subtle and artistic greeting card left interior panel. A full-bleed background with a light off-white watercolor paper texture. Cascading from the top-left corner is a delicate, decorative arrangement of abstract watercolor elements in shades of park green, sky blue, and a cheerful yellow-orange. These shapes are a mix of soft, translucent splotches and gentle brush strokes, creating a sense of confetti-like movement that complements the front cover without being overpowering. The composition is asymmetrical and leaves ample white space. Flat 2D in a whimsical, illustrative watercolor style.",
    "rightInterior": "Minimalist greeting card right interior panel, designed to beautifully frame a personal message. The background is a clean, off-white watercolor paper texture. In the bottom-right corner, a small, tasteful cluster of three overlapping watercolor splotches in muted green, teal, and soft orange adds a touch of color and visual interest. The artwork is subtle and positioned to leave the majority of the panel open, creating an elegant and spacious area for handwritten text. Flat 2D with soft, organic paint bleed edges, maintaining artistic cohesion with the other panels.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan! We\u2019re pretty sure your birthday wish was for us to not be around to embarrass you, so... you're welcome! We hope you have a fantastic day, eat way too much ice cream. And it\u2019s so fitting that you have the perfect pink shorts to wear to your party! We're sending all our love from afar!\n\nLots of love,\nMom, Dad, and Jasmine\""
