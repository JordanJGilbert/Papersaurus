TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a charming and celebratory watercolor illustration. The scene depicts a friendly, illustrated Papersaurus dinosaur, rendered with soft, blended watercolor washes in warm shades of sage green and happy ochre. The dinosaur is playfully holding up a small, stylized laptop or tablet displaying the Papersaurus.com logo, beaming with a hand-painted smile. Around it, a delicate and joyful explosion of confetti and tiny, abstract celebratory shapes float in the air, painted in vibrant yet gentle hues of coral, sunny yellow, and sky blue. The background is a soft, creamy wash, allowing the cheerful character and colorful details to pop. The entire style has a loose, organic feel, with visible watercolor blooms and feathered edges, giving it a handcrafted, personal touch that feels both professional and full of heart.\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in a charming and celebratory watercolor illustration.

The artwork depicts a \\\"cartoon of us\\\" inspired scene, likely representing scientists or innovators. Two characters, stylized as enthusiastic scientists with goggles and lab coats, are giving each other a high-five under a \\\"CONGRATULATIONS!\\\" banner rendered in a bold, comic-book style with a yellow-orange starburst. The character on the left has wild, spiky orange hair and a beard, holding a sign that reads \\\"HAR M {\\\". The character on the right has curly dark hair and is holding a sign that reads \\\"START X 2025\\\". Between them, a cheerful, green cartoon dinosaur character is interacting with a stylized laptop placed inside a large, bubbling laboratory flask. The flask contains green, bubbly liquid. The background is a deep, textured teal, with abstract lab equipment and swirling lines in vibrant blues, pinks, and yellows, creating a dynamic and energetic atmosphere. The overall color palette is bold and saturated, with strong outlines and a slightly textured finish reminiscent of distressed printing. The artistic style is a unique blend of retro comic art and modern illustration, with exaggerated features and expressive poses that convey excitement and achievement.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card in a 9:16 aspect ratio, continuing the \\\"Smart Style\\\" and humorous tone from the front. The design is a cohesive visual narrative with a peaceful resolution. It features the same bold, saturated color palette and textured illustration style. The background is a consistent deep teal, with abstract, subtle swirls and dots in vibrant blues and pinks. Dominating the center-left is a stylized, abstract representation of the \\\"Papersaurus.com\\\" logo or a similar thematic element, rendered in bright, celebratory colors. This could be a simplified, geometric dinosaur shape or a cluster of colorful, abstract shapes. The bottom-right corner (approximately 1 inch square) is intentionally left clear and undecorated for a QR code.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a simple yet striking minimalist illustration. The artwork features a round-bottomed flask, rendered in a clean, flat 2D style with thick black outlines. The flask is filled with a vibrant orange liquid, within which a stylized green dinosaur footprint is clearly visible. Above the flask, a few small circles in shades of orange and yellow suggest bubbles rising from the liquid, adding a playful touch. The entire illustration is set against a solid, deep teal blue background that extends to the full bleed of the card. This composition is balanced and uncluttered, focusing attention on the central graphic element, and leaves ample negative space on the right side, suggesting a reserved area for a QR code. The style is modern and graphic, with a limited color palette that creates a cohesive and visually appealing design, subtly referencing the scientific or exploratory theme implied by the flask and footprint, bringing a gentle and artistic closure to the card's narrative without any text or human figures.",

The central focus is a rounded-bottom flask with a narrow neck, rendered with thick, black outlines. The flask is filled with an opaque, gradient orange liquid, transitioning to a lighter peach tone at the top. Within the orange liquid, a stylized, bright green dinosaur footprint is prominently featured, also outlined in black. Scattered around the footprint within the liquid are small, solid black dots, representing bubbles or effervescence. Emerging from the neck of the flask are three abstract circular shapes, also outlined in black: one large golden-yellow circle at the top, and two smaller circles below it, one orange and one white. These circles are positioned to suggest a reaction or bubbling effect. The overall aesthetic is clean, minimalist, and graphic, with a playful yet intelligent visual concept.

Dominating the upper center is a bold, starburst-shaped banner in bright yellow and orange with the word \"CONGRATULATIONS!\" in a thick, black outline, mimicking a 1960s comic book style. Below this, two animated, cartoon scientists in white lab coats and goggles are enthusiastically high-fiving. The scientist on the left has wild, spiky orange hair and a beard, holding a sign that reads \"HAR M{}\", while the scientist on the right has curly black hair and is holding a sign that reads \"START X 2025\".
