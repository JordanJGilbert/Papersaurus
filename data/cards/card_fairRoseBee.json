    "frontCover": "A beautiful and sentimental watercolor illustration for a greeting card front. In the center, an illustrated version of Grandpa from the reference photo is sitting on a simple wooden stool on a pier, looking warmly towards Tong Tong. Tong Tong, as seen on the right in the photo, is a young child, standing next to him and joyfully presenting him with a large, beautifully drawn crab. Their clothing is inspired by the photo, but without any text or logos. The scene is set against a serene harbor at sunset. The background features soft, blended watercolor washes of orange, pink, and light blue. A traditional wooden Chinese boat bobs gently on the calm water in the distance. Whimsical, light watercolor illustrations of Chinese opera masks and various seashells are subtly integrated into the sky like soft clouds or constellations, celebrating his interests in a dreamlike way. The overall atmosphere is full of warmth, love, and cherished memories. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\". The art style is flat 2D, with soft edges and flowing colors typical of watercolor painting.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean greeting card back cover design. The background is a full-bleed, soft watercolor wash of pale cream with subtle hints of light blue and soft orange at the edges, evoking a serene sunset sky. In the center, there is a single, elegantly drawn watercolor illustration of a traditional wooden Chinese boat, rendered with artistic brush strokes and soft, flowing colors. The design is simple, leaving ample negative space, particularly ensuring the bottom-right quadrant is completely clear for a QR code. The artwork is flat 2D with a gentle paper texture visible throughout. Final image should be a high-quality, polished version of the provided draft, with enhanced detail, corrected imperfections, and improved color vibrancy.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative greeting card left interior panel. The background is a full-bleed, soft watercolor wash blending pale blues and soft pinks, reminiscent of a calm dawn sky over the water. A beautiful, artistic border is created along the bottom edge, featuring a tastefully arranged collection of watercolor elements: delicate seashells, a detailed crab, and an elegant Chinese opera mask. The illustrations are rendered in the same soft, flowing watercolor style as the front cover, with warm oranges, pinks, and blues. The composition is asymmetrical and occupies about 40% of the page, creating a beautiful yet understated decorative panel with no text. Final image should be a high-quality, polished version of the provided draft, with enhanced detail, corrected imperfections, and improved color vibrancy.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist and elegant greeting card right interior panel, designed to hold a personal message. The background is a very light, almost white, cream watercolor wash with subtle hints of soft pink at the top and bottom edges, providing a clean and warm canvas. A small, simple watercolor illustration of two intertwined seashells is placed in the bottom left corner as a delicate accent. This decorative element is minimal, occupying no more than 20% of the space, ensuring the majority of the panel is open and ready for a handwritten message. The artwork is flat 2D with a soft paper texture. Final image should be a high-quality, polished version of the provided draft, with enhanced detail, corrected imperfections, and improved color vibrancy.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Dear Grandpa, \n\nHappy Birthday! Today would've been your 92nd birthday! I hope the weather is nice up there and you are eating all types of good food. I know you like seafood, especially stir-fried snails with perilla leaf. It is not in season for another couple months but maybe they have everything in season where you live. I probably would've made you some spaghetti with apple sausages or chicken because that's the only thing I know how to make well haha. I was sad yesterday that you are not here with us. Sometimes I wished I took you to eat at more places. It also made me sad to think you are all alone up there but then I remember that your parents and siblings are probably up there too. You'll be a great-grandpa in a few months! I dont know f you heard us, but Erica told you that she was pregnant when you were in the hospital. We miss you very much and I am sure grandma does too. Have a fun birthday!\n\nWith love, \nTong Tong\""
