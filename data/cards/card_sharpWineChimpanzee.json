  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing birthday greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\nðŸŽ¨ CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clichÃ© designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"create a graduation card for us\"\nStyle: ðŸ¤– AI Smart Style\nTone: ðŸ˜„ Funny - humorous and lighthearted\n\n\nMessage: \"Congrats on graduating to another year older! You've officially earned a degree in being awesome, with a minor in not acting your age. So proud of you!\"\n\nReference: \"turn both of us into cartoons\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n- Create cartoon/illustrated characters inspired by reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a modern, stylized gouache and ink illustration style that balances celebratory energy with sophisticated nostalgia. The artwork should feature a rich, jewel-toned color palette dominated by deep emerald green, sapphire blue, and a warm, antique gold, accented with pops of creamy white and a soft, dusty rose. The central figure, based on the reference photo, will be rendered with clean, confident ink lines for their silhouette and key features, but the clothing (graduation gown) and hair will be filled with flat, opaque layers of gouache, showcasing visible, yet subtle, brushstrokes to add texture and a handcrafted feel. The background will be a semi-abstract wash of the emerald and sapphire tones, bleeding softly into one another, perhaps with delicate, hand-drawn constellations or scattered geometric shapes (like triangles and arcs) subtly overlaid in thin gold ink, symbolizing future opportunities and aspirations. Key elements, like the graduation cap's tassel and any diploma shown, should be highlighted with shimmering metallic gold gouache, making them catch the light. The overall mood is one of quiet triumph and eleganceâ€”less about a raucous party and more about the beautiful, poignant culmination of a significant chapter.\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! The AI has complete creative freedom to design whatever it wants for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a birthday card with humorous and lighthearted tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description. Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before!

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a bold, cartoonish, and vibrant illustration style. The background is a bright, almost neon green, reminiscent of laboratory equipment or scientific diagrams. Dominating the scene are two cartoon characters, a boy and a girl, dressed in white lab coats, dark blue pants, and oversized, round, lime green goggles. Both characters have wide, enthusiastic smiles and dark hair. The boy wears a floral print shirt peeking from under his lab coat and a purple graduation cap with a yellow tassel. The girl also wears a graduation cap, identical to the boy's. The boy is holding up a purple, multi-layered cake under a glass dome, topped with a lit purple candle. The girl is looking towards the cake, also with excitement. Behind them, a stylized laboratory setting is depicted with various scientific apparatuses rendered in bold purple and blue outlines. This includes flasks filled with green and purple liquids, beakers, a computer monitor displaying a waveform, and a small, robotic arm with a graduation cap. The text \"HAPPY GRADUATION DAY!\" is prominently displayed at the top in a thick, purple, sans-serif font. Below it, in a smaller, yellow font, is the phrase \"(..TO ANOTHER YEAR OLDER)\". The overall mood is celebratory, humorous, and slightly quirky, with a focus on a science or lab theme for graduation. The illustration uses thick black outlines for all elements, flat areas of color, and minimal shading, creating a distinct 2D graphic novel aesthetic.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a blueprint theme, in a minimalist, schematic illustration style. The background is a deep, muted navy blue. The design features a simple, stylized line drawing of a laboratory flask with a bubbling liquid and a pipette, rendered in a light, desaturated grey, positioned in the lower right corner, subtly referencing the \"Awesome Output\" of the blueprint. There is no text or other prominent decorative elements, creating a clean and understated closure that complements the front cover's technical and humorous theme. The overall composition is clean and focused, with ample negative space.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a humorous and lighthearted tone, rendered in a bold, flat 2D graphic illustration style. The background is a vibrant, almost neon lime green, filled with scattered geometric shapes in deep indigo and magenta. These shapes include small triangles, circles, and short lines, evoking a festive confetti or party atmosphere. Dominating the center of the image is a large, energetic starburst or explosion, with sharp, radiating points in bright magenta, emanating from a darker indigo core. On either side of this central burst, stylized, simplified hands are depicted giving a \"thumbs up\" gesture, in a similar flat indigo outline style. There are two slices of birthday cake, also rendered in flat indigo with magenta icing and a single lit candle each, placed towards the bottom of the image, adding to the celebratory, yet slightly quirky, theme. A graduation cap, in indigo with a magenta tassel, is positioned in the upper left quadrant, subtly referencing the graduation theme. The overall composition is dynamic and playful, using a limited but impactful color palette to create a high-energy, celebratory feel consistent with a funny birthday card. There is no text present on this specific page, allowing the graphic elements to communicate the message of fun and congratulations.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with the text \"Congrats on graduating to another year older! You've officially earned a degree in being awesome, with a minor in not acting your age. So proud of you!\" prominently displayed. The text is presented in a bold, dark serif font, with \"Congrats on graduating to another year older!\" as the main headline, followed by the supporting message and a horizontal line indicating a space for a handwritten note. The entire text block is centrally framed by a stylized, thick border resembling laboratory glassware and piping. This border features a series of interconnected pipes, valves, and flasks, with one flask at the top left emitting bubbling liquid and another at the bottom right containing similar bubbling liquid. There are also subtle electrical sparks emanating from a junction in the upper right piping. The artwork has a flat 2D aesthetic with clean, bold black outlines. The background is a vibrant, uniform lime green. The overall style is reminiscent of vintage scientific diagrams or blueprints, with a touch of playful, almost cartoonish, execution of the scientific elements. The design is clean and graphic, ensuring excellent readability for the printed message and ample surrounding space for personal inscriptions."
