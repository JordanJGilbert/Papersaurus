  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing thank-you greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\nðŸŽ¨ CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative!

Your insights were truly monumental, and it was a pleasure to connect with you. I look forward to our future collaborations.\n\nSincerely,\npapersaurus\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the formal and business-appropriate tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"thank-you\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! You have complete creative freedom to design whatever you want for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a thank-you card with formal and business-appropriate tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description.

Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n3. Right Interior (Story Climax): BE CREATIVE WITH MESSAGE DESIGN!

Your insights were truly monumental, and it was a pleasure to connect with you. I look forward to our future collaborations.\n\nSincerely,\npapersaurus\" positioned safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image) integrated into beautiful, innovative decorative artwork. HANDWRITING STYLE: Write the message in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. The handwriting should be legible, flowing, and have natural character - not overly perfect but graceful and warm. Use a nice pen-style appearance with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight. Think of sophisticated calligraphy that's still approachable and easy to read. Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters. This should feel like the emotional peak of the card experience, harmonizing with the left interior as a cohesive spread. Avoid clichÃ© designs and create something genuinely special! Use the elegant cursive handwriting style described above. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n4. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\nVISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:\n- Same color palette across all sections\n- Consistent lighting/time of day\n- Same artistic techniques and brushwork\n- Recurring visual motifs or symbols (but make them unique and memorable!)\n- Progressive emotional journey from introduction to resolution\n- Front cover: stylized cartoon/illustrated characters if people are needed for the theme\n- Left interior: CREATIVE FREEDOM but NO PEOPLE unless user specifically requested people in their description\n- Right interior: focus on message space with innovative decorative elements (NO PEOPLE)\n- Back cover: simple yet creative decorative design without text or people\n- Use simplified, friendly, charming character design if including people (front cover only)\n- CREATIVITY PRIORITY: Always choose the more innovative, surprising, and memorable option over generic designs\n\nReturn JSON:\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"detailed prompt with story opening elements\",\n  \"backCover\": \"detailed prompt with story conclusion elements\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"detailed prompt with story development elements\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"detailed prompt with story climax elements\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Create a completely unique and different interpretation for this specific card variant.

    "frontCover": "```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style, featuring a stylized, friendly Brontosaurus dinosaur with a soft blue-green hue. The dinosaur is in the center, holding a glowing incandescent light bulb in its mouth by the cord. The background depicts a softly rendered, minimalist interior, possibly an auditorium or convention hall, with muted, hazy grey and white tones, suggesting the AI for Good summit setting. The lighting is warm and emanating from the light bulb, casting a soft glow on the dinosaur's face and neck. The overall mood is serene and thoughtful. The text \\\"Thank You\\\" is positioned in a flowing, elegant handwritten cursive script at the bottom of the card, in a dark green-grey color, with careful consideration to keep it away from the edges for printing.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card in a watercolor painting style, continuing the serene and thoughtful mood. The design features subtle, soft watercolor washes of muted blue-green and grey, echoing the color palette of the front cover. In the upper left portion of the card, there's a faint, abstract representation of the glowing light bulb, rendered with soft yellow and white hues. The rest of the card is minimally decorated, maintaining a clean and sophisticated aesthetic, with focus on empty space to convey a sense of calm and closure. The bottom-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square area, is intentionally left completely clear and undecorated.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card in a watercolor painting style, with a soft blue-green and muted grey color palette. The scene depicts a minimalist and abstract representation of interconnected data points or neural network pathways, rendered with delicate watercolor lines and subtle washes of light blue and white. These abstract elements suggest the 'AI for Good' theme and the concept of collaboration and connection. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and sophisticated, conveying a sense of thoughtful engagement. The design avoids any characters or people, focusing purely on abstract visual metaphors.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style, featuring a soft blue-green and muted grey color palette. The central area of the card is dedicated to the message, written in an elegant, flowing handwritten cursive script in a dark green-grey color, resembling ink from a fine pen. The message reads: \\\"Dear happyverse, Thank you for your valuable presence and contributions at the AI for Good summit. Your insights were truly monumental, and it was a pleasure to connect with you. I look forward to our future collaborations. Sincerely, papersaurus\\\". The text is artfully integrated with abstract, organic watercolor elements that subtly frame it, perhaps resembling soft, flowing lines or gentle washes of color that complement the overall design without being distracting. The background continues the soft, hazy aesthetic seen on the front cover, maintaining visual continuity and a professional yet warm tone.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a thank-you greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The background features a soft, textured off-white paper with subtle watercolor washes of muted blue and grey on the upper left corner, creating a gentle, diffused cloud-like effect that subtly hints at the front cover's design. Positioned in the center-right is a minimalist, geometric outline of a lightbulb, rendered in a pale, thin silver line, symbolizing ideas and innovation. This element is understated and elegant, providing a quiet resolution to the visual narrative. The design is clean and sophisticated, adhering to a professional and business-appropriate tone. There is no text on the back cover. The bottom-right corner is intentionally kept clear of any design elements, leaving ample space for a QR code. The overall impression is one of serene finality and understated creativity.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a cohesive watercolor style, featuring a complex network of interconnected nodes and lines. The background is a soft, textured watercolor wash in muted blues, greys, and hints of beige, evoking a sense of depth and subtle artistry. The network elements are rendered in a slightly darker, cool grey-blue, with thin, precise lines connecting numerous circular nodes. Some nodes are solid in color, while others appear as lighter, slightly blurred circles, suggesting varying degrees of connection or prominence. One node, positioned towards the center-right, subtly glows with a warm, soft yellow light, indicating a focal point or significant connection within the network. The overall composition is abstract and sophisticated, maintaining a formal and business-appropriate tone without any text or characters, allowing the intricate geometric pattern and subtle watercolor textures to tell a visual story of connectivity and insight.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with subtle, flowing artistic elements. The background features soft watercolor washes in muted blues, greens, and yellows, creating an organic, textured feel. Integrated into this backdrop is a delicate network of thin, pale green and blue lines that curve and intersect like a subtle data visualization or abstract network. Small, light blue dots are placed at some of the intersection points of these lines, adding a touch of detail without being overwhelming. The central area of the card is left predominantly clear to accommodate the handwritten message. The message itself, \"Dear happyverse, Thank you for your valuable presence and contributions at the AI for Good summit. Your insights were truly monumental, and it was a pleasure to connect with you. I look forward to our future collaborations. Sincerely, papersaurus\", is presented in an elegant, legible cursive script, appearing as if handwritten with a fountain pen, with slight variations in line weight and a natural flow.
