Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm, minimalist watercolor and ink style. The front of the card features a single, beautifully rendered tree, reminiscent of a mighty oak or a resilient redwood, symbolizing wisdom, growth, and enduring thought. The watercolor is applied with a gentle, wet-on-wet technique, allowing soft, earthy greens and rich, warm browns to bleed into each other gracefully, creating a sense of natural, organic life. Fine, delicate ink lines are used to define the branches and a few key leaves, adding a touch of sophisticated detail without sacrificing the soft, painterly feel.

The tree's trunk and branches are rendered in thin, delicate brown ink lines, with a subtle watercolor wash suggesting warmth. Instead of leaves, the branches are adorned with various colorful geometric shapes: light blue squares, teal circles, green triangles, and golden yellow triangles and squares. The watercolor application is soft and blended, with a clean, white background that emphasizes the central illustration. The overall style is minimalist, elegant, and symbolic, conveying growth, ideas, and professionalism. Below the tree, centered in the lower half of the card, the text \\\"John Gilbert\\\" is displayed in a bold, clean, sans-serif black font. Underneath, in a slightly smaller, equally clean black font, reads \\\"AI For Good Conference Stanford CA June 2025\\\". The mood is inspirational and professional, with a hint of artistic charm. The artistic style is a blend of minimalist watercolor and precise ink illustration, creating a sophisticated and unique visual.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, continuing the minimalist watercolor and ink style of the front cover. The design subtly references the geometric motifs from the front cover, perhaps with a few scattered, soft watercolor shapes (e.g., a faint blue circle or a muted yellow triangle) in the upper left or center area. The primary focus is on creating a serene and resolved atmosphere. There are no people or text. The bottom right corner (approximately 1 inch square) is intentionally left completely clear and undecorated for a QR code.

This page develops the visual narrative by expanding on the symbolism of growth and interconnectedness. It could feature delicate, flowing ink lines that suggest a gentle breeze or the spread of ideas, subtly interweaving with faint watercolor washes in earthy tones or muted colors from the front cover's palette. Perhaps a subtle pattern of the geometric shapes appears in a very soft, diffused manner, or a single, larger abstract watercolor shape that evokes the 'good' or 'prospering thought' mentioned in the theme. The overall mood is calm, inspirational, and visually harmonious with the front cover, creating a sense of gentle unfolding and thoughtful consideration.

The artistic elements surrounding the text are abstract and sophisticated, possibly abstract watercolor blooms in soft, warm hues, or delicate ink-drawn tendrils that gracefully frame the message. These elements should not depict people but rather evoke inspiration and thoughtful reflection, harmonizing with the 'AI for Good' and 'prospering thought' theme. The composition is balanced, ensuring the text is easily readable while the artwork enhances the heartfelt and professional tone.\"\n}\n```",

The bottom-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square, is intentionally left completely clear and undecorated to allow space for a QR code.

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a \"Smart Style\" and \"Inspirational\" tone, rendered in a warm, minimalist watercolor and ink style. The composition features soft, abstract watercolor shapes in muted yellow and blue-green hues, bleeding gently into each other.

In the upper left quadrant, a soft, muted sage green watercolor square is placed. In the lower right, a gentle sky blue watercolor circle and a warm ochre watercolor triangle are arranged in a balanced composition. These shapes are rendered with a delicate watercolor wash technique, featuring soft edges and subtle color variations, evoking a sense of calm and thoughtfulness. The overall artistic style is a warm, minimalist watercolor and ink, with the watercolor washes creating a painterly texture and fine ink lines subtly defining elements where necessary, though in this specific interior page, the focus is on the watercolor shapes rather than ink outlines. The design prioritizes readability and emotional resonance for the message, using abstract forms to create visual interest without overpowering the sentiment."
