    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card. A dreamy fantasy beach scene where the world is humorously dedicated to orange chicken. Lao Lao and Jordan are depicted as cartoon characters based on the reference photo. They are sitting together on a whimsical picnic blanket on the sand. Jordan is playfully trying to feed a piece of Panda Express orange chicken to Lao Lao, who is laughing with a happy, surprised expression.

In the sky, fluffy white clouds are shaped like pieces of orange chicken, and the sun is a glowing takeout box. The overall aesthetic is magical, ethereal, and very funny.
