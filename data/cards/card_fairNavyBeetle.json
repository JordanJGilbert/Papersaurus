    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, in a humorous and slightly exaggerated comic book illustration style. The main subject is a man with a distressed expression, a tiny, slightly askew silver crown perched on his head, and wide, surprised eyes. He is wearing an orange t-shirt and blue jeans. He holds a fork in his right hand and a slice of pink-frosted cake on a blue-rimmed white plate in his left. The text \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOUR HIGHNESS!\" is prominently displayed in large, bold, yellow bubble letters with a black outline, centered on his t-shirt. The background features a vibrant blue sky with white, fluffy clouds and numerous pink and purple ribbons streaming across it, suggesting a festive but chaotic party atmosphere. To the right, a whimsical, cartoonish pink castle with multiple turrets is visible. In the foreground, on the green grass, are three small, stout garden gnomes wearing pink conical hats and blue tunics. The overall color palette is bright and saturated, with a strong emphasis on orange, pink, blue, and yellow, creating a playful and energetic mood. The art style is characterized by thick, dark outlines, flat colors with some subtle shading, and a generally stylized, almost caricatured depiction of the characters and setting.",

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a humorous and lighthearted tone, rendered in a bold, graphic, 2D flat illustration style reminiscent of vintage comic art with a distinct pop art influence. The scene is set on a vibrant, textured pink tablecloth, with a high-contrast, textured orange background. Dominating the composition is a stylized yellow juice box, labeled \"NOBLE NECTAR (SPARKLING JUICE)\" with a playful crown graphic above the text, emitting a puddle of bright yellow \"juice\" that spills across the table. Scattered around are oversized, brightly colored cartoonish jewels (blue, green, and red) set in chunky yellow rings, a golden star, and a simple cylinder. In the foreground, a large, pink balloon animal horse lies on its side, its form exaggerated and slightly deflated, contributing to the whimsical, slightly absurd humor. The linework is thick and black, with minimal shading, and a grainy texture is applied throughout, giving it a tactile, printed feel. The overall impression is a quirky, unexpected \"royal\" party setup, full of playful opulence and a touch of slapstick.",

Seeing you surrounded by so much joy today reminds me of all the magic you bring into my life just by being you. Happy Birthday to my forever fairytale. All my love, Jordan\". The text is in a clear, sans-serif font with varying sizes and weights for emphasis, with \"Happy Birthday\" being larger and bolder. The speech bubble has a thick, dark outline that transitions to a softer purple on the bottom curve. The background of the card is a light cream color, sparsely decorated with small, dashed lines in light pink and purple, resembling confetti. At the top of the speech bubble, a simple, stylized yellow crown with purple gem accents is positioned, aligning with the \"prince\" theme. The overall color palette is soft and celebratory, using pastels and warm tones. The design emphasizes the message with the speech bubble acting as a prominent frame, while the subtle background confetti and the crown provide thematic context without overwhelming the text. The style is flat 2D artwork suitable for printing, with a full-bleed background. No other decorative elements or borders are present beyond the speech bubble and confetti."
