The background is a gentle wash of pastel yellow and airy sky blue. Delicate, leafy green vines organically weave across the page, cradling glowing yellow lightbulbs with blue bases. The vines and lightbulbs form a natural, whimsical frame around the quote. Positioned near the top right are a blue binder clip, a yellow pencil with a pink eraser, and a subtle smiling face icon. Near the top left, a heart-shaped paperclip in a warm orange hue. The quote \"The human brain is a wonderful organ. It starts working the moment you get up in the morning and does not stop until you get into the office.\" is presented in clear, legible dark blue text, followed by \"- Robert Frost\" in slightly smaller, matching text, all carefully placed within the central area of the illustration to avoid any cropping issues.

The color palette consists of muted blues, soft yellows from the bulbs, and the green of the dinosaur, creating a cohesive and heartwarming atmosphere. The design prioritizes clarity of the message while incorporating charming, lighthearted decorative elements that are integrated rather than overpowering."
