    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design on a textured paper background. A single, graceful pink ballet ribbon playfully loops and curls across the center and left side of the card, its painted shadow giving it a sense of depth. A few scattered pieces of delicate, multi-colored confetti from the front cover float gently around the ribbon, creating a subtle connection to the main story. The overall feeling is serene and peaceful, providing a quiet artistic conclusion. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left blank and undecorated.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor painting of two cartoon characters attempting a ballet arabesque in a whimsical living room. A young woman with her hair in a messy bun and a smaller girl with dark hair are both wobbling precariously on one leg, arms askew, with comically determined expressions. They are surrounded by a playful explosion of floating birthday confetti and streamers. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, flowing handwritten cursive script. The scene is full of soft, flowing pastel colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background, creating a warm and funny first impression. Key elements and faces are kept away from the edges for safe printing.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "An artistic and humorous watercolor still life on a textured paper background. Two whimsical, mismatched teacups are the central focus. One teacup is precariously tipped over, spilling a splash of imaginary tea that morphs into a cascade of colorful, sparkling confetti and tiny musical notes. The other teacup sits upright, filled with a swirl of pastel colors. Floating around them are delicate, translucent ballet ribbons and a few rogue birthday candles that seem to be dancing. The scene captures a moment of playful chaos and anticipation, rendered with soft, flowing colors and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design on a textured paper background, framing the handwritten message. A cascade of colorful pastel confetti and delicate, floating ballet ribbons gently rains down from the top left corner, swirling gracefully around the central text area before pooling softly at the bottom right. The design is whimsical and decorative, creating an elegant and artistic space for the message. In the center, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script: \"Vivi,\\nHappy Birthday! Hope your day is absolutely wonderful and that you're showered with love, presents, and way more cake than a person can gracefully handle. Speaking of grace, may your year ahead be much smoother than our arabesque attempts. Can\u2019t wait for another tea party!\\n\\nLove,\\nJasmine\". The text is positioned safely away from the edges."
