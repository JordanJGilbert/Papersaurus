    "frontCover": "A charming, humorous watercolor illustration of a sophisticated llama wearing a tiny, tilted party hat and stylish eyeglasses. The llama has a slightly smug, knowing expression, as if it knows all the secrets to aging gracefully (or disgracefully). Floating around the llama are a few delicate, pastel-colored soap bubbles, catching the light. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds at the edges of the colors. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable, and slightly playful handwritten cursive script, is the text ",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor background that matches the front cover. A single, delicate, pastel-colored soap bubble floats gently in the upper-left corner, catching the light. The artwork is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds at the edges of the colors, creating a full-bleed design. The background is a clean wash of the same soft pastel color from the front. The bottom-right corner area is intentionally left completely blank and unadorned. Flat 2D artwork.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and abstract full-bleed watercolor pattern. A cascade of delicate, pastel-colored soap bubbles of various sizes drifts gracefully from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right. The entire scene is rendered in the same soft, flowing watercolor style as the front cover, with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds at the edges of the colors. The background is a clean, minimalist wash of a single soft color, consistent with the rest of the card.",
    "rightInterior": "Decorative watercolor art serving as a backdrop for a message. In the upper portion, a cluster of delicate, iridescent, pastel-colored soap bubbles float whimsically. Below, the message \"May your day be as wonderfully extra as you are.\" is written in the center in the same beautiful, readable, and slightly playful handwritten cursive script from the front cover. The entire design is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture and artistic brush strokes, against a full-bleed wash of a single soft color matching the front. Key elements are kept away from the edges."
