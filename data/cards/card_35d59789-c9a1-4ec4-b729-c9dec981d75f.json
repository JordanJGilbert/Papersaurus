    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that provides a peaceful conclusion. A single, beautifully rendered cartoon diamond, echoing the 'priceless' theme from the front cover, rests in the center-left of the card. It gently sparkles with soft, radiating watercolor light effects in pastel pink and lavender. The background is a clean, creamy white with subtle watercolor paper texture, and a soft, faint wash of light blue from the main color palette is visible along the left edge. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor scene. Two cute cartoon characters, inspired by Lao Lao and Jordan, are standing side-by-side. The Jordan character proudly presents a large, beautifully wrapped gift box to the Lao Lao character, who looks on with excited anticipation. Above them, in a dreamy watercolor cloud, a thought bubble shows the Jordan character striking a heroic pose, shining like a priceless diamond. The background is a soft, whimsical watercolor wash of pastel pinks, lavenders, and light blues. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is a soft watercolor painting with flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture.",
    "leftInterior": "An artistic and funny watercolor illustration showcasing a magnificent, empty pedestal on a grand stage. The pedestal, ornately detailed with gold watercolor accents, has a velvet rope barrier around it, as if protecting a priceless artifact in a museum. A single spotlight, rendered in soft yellow watercolor, shines down from above onto the empty top of the pedestal. The background is a dramatic yet soft wash of deep blues and purples, suggesting a hushed, reverent gallery space, but with a humorous and lighthearted feel.",
    "rightInterior": "The heartfelt and funny message is the centerpiece, beautifully integrated into a decorative watercolor design. The text 'Happy Birthday to my wonderful girlfriend, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a ridiculously expensive gift, but then I remembered my presence is priceless. You're welcome! I love you more than anything. Love, Jordan' is written in an elegant, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The text is framed by a whimsical watercolor explosion of celebratory confetti and shimmering sparkles, painted in the card's color palette of pastel pinks, lavenders, and light blues. The confetti pieces look like tiny, colorful jewels, reinforcing the 'priceless' joke in a beautiful, artistic way. The background is a soft, creamy off-white with visible paper texture and gentle paint bleeds at the edges."
