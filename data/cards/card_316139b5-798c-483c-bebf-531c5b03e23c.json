    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor design that concludes the visual story. On the left side of the card, the ornate golden frame from the front cover is shown empty and leaning against a soft, pastel-colored wall, symbolizing the end of the 'exhibit'. A few delicate, whimsical watercolor paint splatters in the card's color palette drift playfully from the center towards the left, as if left over from the artistic creation. The entire right side of the card, especially the bottom-right corner, is left clean and undecorated. The overall feeling is peaceful, artistic, and subtly humorous, with soft flowing colors, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor painting of a cartoon couple, inspired by Jordan and Lao Lao, standing in a vast, empty art gallery. Jordan, with a proud, beaming smile, gestures with a flourish to a single, ridiculously oversized, ornate golden frame hanging on the wall. Inside the frame, instead of a painting, is just Jordan himself, striking a heroic, priceless pose with a halo glowing faintly above his head. Lao Lao is looking at him with a loving, amused, and slightly exasperated expression, one hand on her hip. The gallery has soft, flowing colors and artistic brush strokes. Centered in the open space below the frame, the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style features soft watercolor washes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, creating a lighthearted and artistic scene.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent the people in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:\n- REPRESENT ALL PEOPLE: If multiple reference photos are provided, create cartoon versions of ALL people shown, bringing them together in the same scene\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles worn by each person in their reference photo\n- COMPLETE accessories: include ALL accessories visible on each person (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.)\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nStudy every detail of the people in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features.

    "leftInterior": "An artistic and funny watercolor illustration depicting a 'priceless' item catalogue. The page is designed like a high-end auction catalog, with several ornate, empty golden frames of different shapes and sizes scattered whimsically. Inside each frame, instead of an item, is a humorous, hand-lettered description of an intangible gift, such as \"Unlimited Hugs (Est. Value: Priceless)\", \"An Endless Supply of Bad Jokes (Est. Value: Also Priceless)\", and \"My Undivided Attention* (*During Commercials) (Est. Value: You Guessed It... Priceless)\". The design uses the same soft watercolor style, with flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture, maintaining a playful and sophisticated tone.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design that elegantly frames the birthday message. The text is the centerpiece, written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The message \"Happy Birthday to my wonderful girlfriend, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a ridiculously expensive gift, but then I remembered my presence is priceless. You're welcome! I love you more than anything. Love, Jordan\" is integrated into the artwork. The decoration is a watercolor illustration of a giant, glowing price tag. Instead of a price, the tag is artistically filled with the handwritten message. The string of the price tag gracefully swirls around the text, adorned with soft, delicate watercolor washes and light, ethereal paint splatters that match the card's color palette. The background is a soft, textured wash of color, creating a climactic and heartfelt focal point. The style uses soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds."
