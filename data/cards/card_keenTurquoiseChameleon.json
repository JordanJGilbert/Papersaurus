    "frontCover": "A dreamy fantasy anime style 2D illustration for a birthday card front cover, flat artwork. The scene is a magical, whimsical forest clearing bathed in soft pastel light. In the center, a cartoon version of John (from reference photo) is hilariously attempting to ride a majestic, slightly clumsy-looking unicorn with a rainbow-colored mane. John is laughing, wearing a comically oversized, sparkling party hat that's tilted to one side. A cartoon version of Lauren (from reference photo) stands beside them, holding a giant, shimmering bubble wand, giggling as iridescent, musical-note-shaped bubbles float all around. The forest is filled with enchanting details: glowing mushrooms, trees with candy-colored leaves, and tiny, mischievous fairies peeking out from behind flowers. In the center of the image, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The overall atmosphere is funny, lighthearted, and full of fairy-tale charm.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A simple and serene back cover for a greeting card, continuing the dreamy fantasy anime style from the front. The artwork features a full-bleed background of the magical forest floor, bathed in the same soft pastel light. A few glowing mushrooms are clustered in the top-left corner, and a single, iridescent, musical-note-shaped bubble floats gently from the top center. The overall design is minimalist and peaceful, with a lot of open space. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is kept completely clear and undecorated for QR code placement. No people, characters, or text.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative, full-bleed interior panel for a greeting card, rendered in a dreamy fantasy anime style that is visually cohesive with the front cover. The artwork features a beautiful, artistic pattern of iridescent, musical-note-shaped bubbles floating upwards against a soft, pastel-colored sky background. The bubbles shimmer with rainbow hues, and the lighting is soft and magical, matching the whimsical tone of the front cover. The design is elegant and lighthearted, serving as a beautiful decorative element. No people, characters, or text.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful 2D illustration for the interior of a birthday card, in a dreamy fantasy anime style. The artwork features a soft, pastel-colored background that subtly depicts the whimsical forest from the front cover. The design is framed with delicate, swirling vines and a few glowing mushrooms along the bottom edge, creating a beautiful border that does not obscure the text. Centrally located and written in a beautiful, elegant, and perfectly legible handwritten cursive script, the following message is displayed with high contrast against the background: \"John,\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but I decided to be nice since you're already having a hard enough time accepting it. Hope you have a fantastic day!\n\nWith love,\nLauren\". The text is the primary focus, positioned safely away from all edges, especially the top and bottom 10%. The overall design is heartfelt and visually harmonious with the rest of the card. No people or characters are depicted."
