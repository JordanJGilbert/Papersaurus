    "frontCover": "A hilarious and chaotic birthday scene in a vibrant, loose watercolor style. Lao Lao, based on the person on the left in the photo, is depicted as a cartoon character sitting on the floor, laughing joyfully with a slice of pepperoni pizza held up like a trophy. She is wearing a blue sweatshirt. Jordan, based on the person on the right, is a cartoon character in a tan hoodie, playfully lunging towards her, trying to steal a bite of the pizza with a mischievous grin. Surrounding them is a comical whirlwind of activity: two ecstatic cartoon dogs (a golden retriever and a corgi) are jumping around, trying to catch falling pepperoni slices. An open pizza box sits between the couple, with a few slices remaining. The background is a soft wash of warm, cheerful colors with subtle watercolor splatters, giving the scene a dynamic and lighthearted energy. Centered in the middle of the composition is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, hand-drawn cursive script. Flat 2D artwork, soft edges, no hard outlines.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. The background is a full-bleed, soft white with a subtle paper texture. In the top-left corner, there is a very small, delicate abstract splash of watercolor paint in shades of warm yellow, muted red, and soft blue, reminiscent of a joyful celebration. The design is simple, clean, and leaves the entire bottom half and right side of the card completely empty. Flat 2D artwork in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and subtle decorative panel for the inside of a greeting card. The design features a full-bleed, light cream background with a visible paper texture. A gentle cascade of abstract watercolor shapes and splatters flows diagonally from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right. The colors are warm and harmonious, using shades of soft tan, muted blue, and cheerful golden yellow, creating a light and airy feel. The artwork is purely decorative and abstract, with no figures or text. Flat 2D artwork in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "An elegantly framed space for a personal message on the interior of a greeting card. The background is a clean, off-white with a very subtle watercolor paper texture. A minimal, artistic border frames the message area, consisting of delicate, abstract watercolor washes in the top-left and bottom-right corners. The colors used are a gentle mix of soft blue and warm tan, providing a touch of color without distracting from the central blank space. The overall design is clean, sophisticated, and message-focused. Flat 2D artwork in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my favorite person, Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to get you a gift, but then I remembered you already have me. You're welcome! I hope your day is as amazing as you are.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
