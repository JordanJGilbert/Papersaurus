    "frontCover": "Here are the detailed prompts for the greeting card, designed to flow chronologically and meet all the specified requirements:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a charming and humorous cartoon style with a warm, inviting color palette dominated by yellows, oranges, and earthy tones. The scene depicts a cozy kitchen setting. A woman with blonde hair in a ponytail, wearing a light pink top, is playfully twirling spaghetti around the ear of a man wearing a brown shirt and an orange baseball cap. The man has spaghetti noodles tangled in his hair, adding to the comedic effect. In the background, on a shelf, are two jars labeled \\\"20 YEARS OF SPICE\\\" and \\\"A PINCH OF CHAOS.\\\" A grey cat with wide, curious eyes peeks out from a lower shelf. A pot of steaming spaghetti sits on a stovetop. The overall mood is lighthearted and affectionate. The text \\\"To Anjana, My Love\\\" is displayed prominently at the top in a flowing, handwritten cursive script, legible and elegant, with a warm, dark brown ink.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, continuing the warm and humorous cartoon style with a consistent color palette of yellows and oranges. The design is minimalist and serene, featuring a single, stylized element: a delicate, winding strand of spaghetti, rendered in the same cheerful yellow as on the front. This spaghetti strand subtly curls and fades towards the center and left of the card, creating a sense of gentle conclusion. The bottom-right corner (approximately 1 inch square) is left completely clear for a QR code. No text or people are present. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and subtly references the main theme of the card.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, in a humorous and heartwarming cartoon style with a consistent warm color palette of yellows and oranges, evoking a cozy kitchen atmosphere. The scene depicts a comical kitchen scenario where the man from the front cover is now trying to eat spaghetti directly from the pot using oversized, comically large chopsticks. Noodles are spilling out of the pot and onto the counter. He has a look of determined, slightly messy enjoyment. The woman from the front cover is watching him with an amused smile, perhaps holding a single strand of spaghetti thoughtfully. Subtle background elements like kitchen cabinets and a window with yellow curtains maintain the visual continuity. The style is flat 2D artwork with clean lines and bold colors, embodying the \\\"Smart Style\\\" and humorous tone. There are no specific text elements on this page.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card, 9:16 ratio, continuing the humorous and heartwarming cartoon style with the established warm color palette. The focus is on the central message, \\\"You are who I am,\\\" rendered in an elegant, flowing handwritten cursive script with a warm, dark brown ink, similar to the front cover. This text is creatively framed by playful, abstract shapes and lines that resemble tangled spaghetti noodles, artfully integrated into a background that subtly echoes the kitchen theme with muted tones of yellow and orange. The overall composition is visually engaging and humorous, with the spaghetti motif acting as a decorative border or flourish around the message. The style is flat 2D artwork, maintaining visual harmony with the rest of the card. No people or characters are depicted on this page.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a 20th anniversary love greeting card with a warm, minimalist watercolor aesthetic. The background is a soft, muted cream color, providing a clean and serene base. A prominent, stylized infinity symbol in a warm golden yellow, outlined with a thin, dark line, dominates the upper portion of the card. Emerging from the top curve of the infinity symbol are two small, vibrant green leaves, suggesting growth and continuity. This central motif is softly framed by a larger, abstract watercolor wash in a peachy-orange hue, with blended edges that create a gentle, organic feel. The overall composition is simple and elegant, evoking a sense of enduring love and growth. In the bottom-right corner, a standard black and white QR code is clearly visible, placed on the cream background with ample clear space around it for its functionality. The design deliberately avoids any text or human figures, focusing solely on symbolic imagery to provide a peaceful and understated resolution to the card's visual narrative. The artistic style is consistent with a flat, 2D illustration, retaining a slightly handmade quality through the watercolor textures. The color palette remains cohesive with soft creams, warm oranges, golden yellows, and a touch of green. The lighting is soft and even, consistent with a flat illustration style. There are no recurring motifs beyond the infinity symbol and the general watercolor texture, ensuring a subtle yet meaningful conclusion.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a love greeting card with a flat 2D artwork style, featuring a bright yellow full-bleed background. The composition is playful and whimsical, showcasing various types of uncooked pasta scattered across the surface. Types of pasta include farfalle (bow-ties), fusilli (corkscrews), and penne. Scattered between the pasta are small, elongated yellow shapes resembling rice grains or sprinkles, adding texture and visual interest. Dominating the center is a large, bold \"20\" in a warm, slightly textured orange-red, positioned above the word \"YEARS\" in a dark brown, sans-serif font. To the left of the \"20\" are two stylized cartoon mugs with cheerful smiley faces, clinking together as if in a toast, with subtle radiating lines suggesting happiness. To the right of \"YEARS\" is a simple brown paw print icon, and below that, two interlocking puzzle pieces, one in a light blue and the other in a grassy green, symbolizing connection and completion. The overall aesthetic is clean, graphic, and uses a limited, cheerful color palette of yellow, orange-red, brown, blue, and green. The elements are arranged with a sense of casual abundance, evoking a lighthearted and celebratory mood.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with the text \"YOU ARE WHO I AM.\" prominently displayed. The background is a textured, muted green with subtle watercolor wash effects, creating a soft, organic feel. The text itself is rendered in a bold, stylized, rounded font with a light yellow-orange gradient and a darker outline, giving it a slightly puffy, almost cartoonish appearance. The letters are large, stacked vertically, and evenly spaced, filling the majority of the central area. In the lower portion of the page, there are scattered small white specks, resembling dust or tiny sparkles, adding a touch of subtle detail. The overall aesthetic is simple, graphic, and impactful, with the message being the clear focal point, presented in a playful yet direct manner. The style is flat 2D artwork with a slight texture overlay to mimic paper."
