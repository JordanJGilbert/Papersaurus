Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.

His head is turned to the right, with a cheerful expression. Above and to his right, a yellow thought bubble with a halftone dot pattern contains an illustration of a prickly pear cactus with a single red flower. To the left of the man's head, a white speech bubble contains an illustration of a black briefcase. To the right of the cactus thought bubble, a white speech bubble contains a stylized blue globe icon, and below that, another white speech bubble contains a blue plus sign. The greeting text \\\"Kudos to you!\\\" is prominently displayed in a large, dark blue, flowing, handwritten cursive script across the top of the card, with the exclamation mark emphasizing the celebratory tone.
