    "frontCover": "A minimalist, humorous, 2D flat illustration for a thank-you greeting card front cover. The design features a stylized cartoon couple, accurately representing Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, against a clean, spacious white background. Lao Lao is depicted joyfully eating a giant cartoon hot dog, while Jordan is shown hilariously upside-down on a roller coaster track loop next to her, his hair comically sticking straight up and a wide-eyed, funny expression of thrill and terror. Faint, minimalist outlines of a Ferris wheel and a single exploding firework are subtly visible in the background. Centered on the card, in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Thank you\". The overall style is defined by clean lines, simple shapes, and a sophisticated, lighthearted feel.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS - ONLY INCLUDE WHAT IS ACTUALLY VISIBLE:\n- REPRESENT ONLY PEOPLE ACTUALLY IN THE PHOTOS: Create cartoon versions of ONLY the people who are actually shown in the reference photos. Do NOT add, create, or imagine any additional people not present in the reference images.\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo - only what is actually visible\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone - exactly as shown in the reference\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate ONLY the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles actually worn by each person in their reference photo - do not add or change any clothing items\n- ACCESSORIES ONLY IF VISIBLE: Include accessories (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.) ONLY if they are actually visible on each person in the reference photo. DO NOT add glasses if they are not wearing glasses in the photo. DO NOT add jewelry if they are not wearing jewelry in the photo. DO NOT add any accessories that are not clearly visible in the reference image.\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual - exactly as they appear\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people are actually shown in the photos, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nCRITICAL RESTRICTION: Do not add, remove, or modify any visual elements beyond what is actually visible in the reference photos. Only include people, clothing, and accessories that are clearly shown in the reference images.\n\nStudy every detail of the people actually in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features. The characters must be immediately recognizable as the same people from the reference photo. Pay special attention to clothing details and accessories that are actually visible, and unique personal style elements that make each person distinctive. Do not add or imagine any elements not present in the reference.\n\nThe cartoon style should be charming and artistic while preserving complete visual accuracy to the reference photo. Only represent people, clothing, and accessories that are actually visible in the reference images."
