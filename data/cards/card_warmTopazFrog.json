FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the fun and energetic tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm and celebratory gouache and colored pencil illustration style, reminiscent of a modern storybook. The scene is set under a soft, starry night sky, with a crescent moon subtly visible. In the background, a gentle silhouette blends the skyline of Abidjan with the iconic domes of MIT, rendered in warm, inviting tones of terracotta, deep blue, and gold. The foreground features Hassan, transformed from his photo into a joyful, illustrated character with a warm smile. He's standing behind stylized DJ decks, but instead of typical equipment, the turntables are beautiful, ornate plates that glow softly, one subtly suggesting a DNA double helix and the other an abstract neural network pattern, all integrated organically into the design. Gentle, colorful fireworks, looking more like blooming flowers of light than explosions, burst softly in the sky, a nod to his July 4th birthday. The overall color palette is rich and warmâ€”using deep blues, warm oranges, soft creams, and touches of gold leaf for a celebratory feel. The entire piece has a hand-painted texture, with visible but soft brushstrokes and delicate colored pencil details, giving it a heartfelt, personal, and lovingly crafted quality that celebrates his journey and bright spirit.\n\n2.
