    "backCover": "A serene and simple watercolor painting. On the left side of the card, the edge of the fluffy white cloud from the front cover is visible, with a few tiny, shimmering golden sparkles gently falling from it. The rest of the design features a soft, minimalist wash of the pastel sky colors from the front cover (blue, pink, and yellow), blending together seamlessly. The overall feeling is peaceful and conclusive. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty, with decorative elements focused on the left and center. The art style maintains the soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and paper texture of the rest of the card.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor painting of two cute cartoon characters, representing Jordan and Lao Lao, standing on a fluffy white cloud. Jordan, the male character, is depicted with a dramatically proud and puffed-out chest, striking a heroic pose with hands on his hips. He's wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans. Lao Lao, the female character, looks at him with a playful, amused expression, one eyebrow raised and a slight smirk. Above them, a shimmering, oversized, empty gift box frame made of pure light floats in the sky. Inside this glowing frame, written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\". The background is a soft, dreamy sky with pastel watercolor washes of blue, pink, and yellow. The style is whimsical and lighthearted, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture.",
    "leftInterior": "A creative watercolor illustration of a giant, ornate, empty pedestal. The pedestal is comically grand, made of marble with whimsical golden trim, and it sits in the center of an empty, minimalist room with soft watercolor-washed walls. A single, dramatic spotlight, painted with soft yellow watercolor, shines down from above, illuminating the empty top of the pedestal, humorously implying it's waiting for a 'priceless' presence. The style is lighthearted and funny, using soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture to match the rest of the card. There are no characters in this scene.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and artistic watercolor design framing the handwritten message. The text is the centerpiece, written in an elegant, flowing, and clearly readable cursive script. The message reads: \"Happy Birthday to my wonderful girlfriend, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a ridiculously expensive gift, but then I remembered my presence is priceless. You're welcome! I love you more than anything. Love, Jordan\". The message is surrounded by a playful, decorative border made of shimmering, golden watercolor sunbeams and sparkles that radiate outwards from the text, as if the words themselves are glowing. This whimsical frame is light and airy, perfectly complementing the humorous and heartfelt tone of the message. The background is a simple, soft cream watercolor wash. The style is consistent, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture."
