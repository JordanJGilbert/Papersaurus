    "backCover": "A minimalist and artistic design that brings the story to a peaceful close. Against a serene pastel watercolor background of soft teal and peach, a single, elegantly swirling ribbon of light\u2014the same one from the front cover\u2014gently drifts across the center of the card from left to middle. A few faint, magical sparkles trail from its end. The design is simple, clean, and subtly references the main visual motif. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated, maintaining a clean space as requested.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and whimsical 2D illustration in a smart, storybook style. An artistic transformation scene depicts a stylish, happy cartoon grandmother with silver hair on the left and a giggling cartoon toddler with blonde pigtails on the right, both celebrating. Floating between them is a magical, glowing birthday cake with two candles. A sparkling, swirling ribbon of light connects the two, transferring from the grandmother to the toddler, who is radiating with playful energy and surrounded by bouncing toys. The grandmother looks lovingly amused, holding a nearly empty teacup. The background is a soft, cheerful pastel watercolor wash of teal and peach. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The art is full-bleed, with characters and key elements kept safely away from the edges.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent the people in these reference photos with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:\n- REPRESENT ALL PEOPLE: If multiple reference photos are provided, create cartoon versions of ALL people shown, bringing them together in the same scene\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles worn by each person in their reference photo\n- COMPLETE accessories: include ALL accessories visible on each person (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.)\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nStudy every detail of the people in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features.

Every person in the reference must be represented with their exact appearance, clothing, and accessories.",
    "leftInterior": "An innovative and artistic full-bleed 2D illustration serving as a visual punchline. The scene depicts a whimsical, oversized \"Energy Meter\" gauge, styled like a vintage scientific instrument but with a playful, cartoonish feel. The needle on the gauge is pointing dramatically to \"Toddler Shenanigans,\" which is at the maximum level. On the far left, labeled \"Grandma's Afternoon Nap,\" the meter is almost at empty. The gauge is beautifully rendered with shiny brass details and glowing magical accents, set against a soft teal and peach watercolor wash background that matches the rest of the card. This abstract concept is executed in a smart, humorous, and visually engaging way without using any characters.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed page featuring the handwritten message in an elegant, legible cursive script. The message \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! It's pretty amazing that you and Vivi share a birthday, although we suspect she's stealing all your energy to power her toddler shenanigans. We hope your special day is filled with as much joy as you bring to all of us! Love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\" is the central focus. The text is framed by a delicate, artistic border composed of gracefully swirling ribbons of light, echoing the front cover's energy transfer motif. The ribbons curve and loop elegantly around the message space, interspersed with soft, glowing sparkles. The background is a continuation of the soft teal and peach watercolor wash, ensuring a cohesive and sophisticated look. The overall design is warm, personal, and artistically unique, with the text and decorative elements safely centered."
