Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor painting style. The design features a simple yet innovative composition, echoing the theme of a feast.

They are positioned over a soft, abstract wash of warm, buttery yellow and orange watercolor, reminiscent of a sunset or warm glow. Subtle splatters of red, orange, and green watercolor are scattered around the cutlery, adding a touch of playful vibrancy. The rest of the card background is a very pale, textured cream, with visible paper grain.

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a watercolor painting style, depicting a humorous art gallery scene. The wall is a soft, pale yellow, textured like watercolor paper, with a hint of blueish-gray at the bottom representing a baseboard. The floor is a grid of pale, warm-toned tiles, also rendered in watercolor with visible brushstrokes and subtle color variations.\n\nDominating the center of the wall is a large, ornate, gilded golden frame, reminiscent of baroque or rococo styles. This frame, rendered with thick, expressive watercolor brushstrokes, encloses a watercolor painting of a classic margherita pizza. The pizza has a golden-brown crust, vibrant red tomato slices, fresh green basil leaves, and melting cheese. Wisps of stylized, light gray steam rise from the pizza, adding a sense of warmth and deliciousness.\n\nTo the left of the large pizza painting, a smaller, similar gilded golden frame hangs. Inside this frame is a still life of sushi rolls, depicted in stacked, artistic arrangement. The sushi rolls are rendered with watercolor detail, showing the dark seaweed wrappers and light-colored fillings.\n\nTo the right of the pizza, another smaller gilded golden frame contains a charming watercolor painting of a tiered pink birthday cake, adorned with small red berries or dots.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in a soft, warm light, creating a gentle atmosphere. The reflections of the framed artworks and the floor tiles are visible on the polished floor, adding depth and a slightly surreal, whimsical quality to the composition. The overall impression is that of a sophisticated art exhibition, but with a playful, unexpected twist, celebrating delicious food as high art, aligning with the theme of a birthday celebration for someone who loves a feast. The color palette is warm and inviting, with dominant yellows, oranges, reds, and greens, all softened by the characteristic flow and transparency of watercolor. The art style is flat 2D, with visible, expressive brushwork and organic paint bleeds, creating a unique and memorable visual.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a prominent, ornate golden frame in the upper two-thirds of the image. The frame has decorative scrollwork at the top and ornate, carved details along its edges, giving it a luxurious and antique feel. The interior of the frame is a blank, off-white space, perfect for handwritten messages. Below the frame, scattered across the bottom portion of the card, is a vibrant and appealing arrangement of various \"buffet\" foods rendered in a charming watercolor style. This includes several pieces of sushi with salmon on top, a generously filled taco, a small wooden bowl of dipping sauce, two spring rolls with visible green filling, and a small stack of colorful macarons in pink, yellow, and green. The background is a soft, warm beige with subtle watercolor washes, creating a gentle, inviting atmosphere. The overall artistic style is watercolor painting, characterized by soft, flowing colors, visible brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, with a full-bleed background. The composition effectively balances the decorative frame and the appetizing food elements, creating a visually rich yet clear space for personalization. The color palette is warm and inviting, dominated by golden yellows, soft oranges, greens, pinks, and the earthy tones of the food, all rendered with a characteristic watercolor softness."
