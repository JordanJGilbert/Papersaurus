    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a retro-futuristic, 80s synthwave aesthetic. The artistic style is a digital art with pixelated elements and a grainy texture, reminiscent of early video games. The color palette is dominated by deep purples, neon pinks, bright blues, and vibrant greens, creating a dramatic and energetic atmosphere.\n\nThe main subjects include a golden, pixelated crown prominently placed in the upper center of the card. Below the crown, large, pixelated text spells out \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" in a bright, glowing green. Scattered throughout the purple background are numerous small, colorful, rectangular confetti pieces in shades of red, blue, green, yellow, and pink, with some exhibiting a motion blur effect. There are also several small, yellow, pixelated smiley face emojis with an \"8\" inside, adding a playful touch.\n\nThe lower portion of the card features a stylized, retro landscape. A large, semi-circular sun or planet, rendered with horizontal stripes of neon pink and blue, sits in the middle distance. In front of the sun, a dark, silhouetted mountain range with sharp peaks is visible. The foreground is dominated by a glowing, neon grid that recedes into the distance, creating a sense of depth. The grid lines are primarily neon pink, with the squares filled in a darker purple or black.\n\nThe layout is centered, with the crown and text as the focal points. The composition draws the viewer's eye from the crown down through the text to the neon grid and landscape, creating a dynamic and engaging visual experience.\n\nThe mood is celebratory, fun, and nostalgic, evoking the feeling of an arcade or an 80s video game. The overall atmosphere is vibrant and energetic. Decorative elements include the confetti, the smiley face emojis, and the distinct retro grid pattern.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a happy birthday card with a minimalist, retro-futuristic aesthetic. The dominant color is a deep, dark indigo or near-black. Centered in the upper half of the frame is a small, pixelated heart in a vibrant, glowing golden yellow. The heart appears to emit a subtle aura or glow. The bottom third of the image features a subtle, stylized grid or wireframe pattern in shades of neon pink and magenta, creating a sense of depth and a digital landscape. There is no visible text or QR code, leaving ample negative space. The overall composition is clean and focused on the central pixelated heart, providing a simple yet resonant visual closure that echoes a digital or nostalgic theme, potentially complementing a similar pixel art or retro-themed front of the card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a bold, expressive, and playful artistic style reminiscent of a modern graffiti or pop art aesthetic. The background is a deep, rich black, serving as a canvas for vibrant, splattered paint effects in neon pink, electric blue, lime green, and yellow, creating a sense of energetic chaos.\n\nDominating the composition is a large bowl filled with stylized, glowing yellow spaghetti, depicted with thick, bold outlines and a luminous quality, suggesting it's radiating heat or light. The bowl itself is outlined in a dark, vibrant purple with thick, vertical pink lines suggesting its structure. Above the spaghetti, in the upper left quadrant, the text \"99%\" is rendered in stark white, bold, sans-serif typography.\n\nIn the upper right, a cartoonish, bright yellow chicken with wide, circular eyes and a small red comb is depicted with its beak open, emitting thin, sharp orange laser-like beams. Its expression is one of surprise or alarm.\n\nIn the lower right quadrant, a melting yellow emoji face, specifically the \"rolling on the floor laughing\" emoji, is shown dripping with a vibrant yellow fluid. The emoji has exaggerated blue tears streaming from its eyes. Below this emoji, in the lower right corner, the text \"99%\" is again displayed in the same white, bold, sans-serif typography.\n\nIn the lower left quadrant, another bright yellow chicken, identical to the one in the upper right, is shown in a dynamic pose, appearing to be flying or diving downwards, also emitting orange laser-like beams from its open beak. Both chickens have simple, flat orange feet.\n\nScattered throughout the background are small, white, asterisk-like starburst shapes, adding further decorative elements and visual interest. The overall composition is asymmetrical yet balanced, with the elements arranged to create a dynamic and engaging visual narrative that feels both humorous and slightly absurd, perfectly complementing a lighthearted \"Happy Birthday\" theme. The use of neon and high-contrast colors against the black background creates a vibrant, almost electric visual impact.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a deep black background. The page is bordered by a vibrant, abstract splatter of paint in electric blues, pinks, purples, oranges, and greens, creating a chaotic and energetic frame. The printed text is in a crisp, white, pixelated font that resembles early computer graphics or retro video games. The message is centrally aligned and fills the majority of the space, leaving ample room for handwritten notes. At the top left, a simple white line drawing of a stylized rocket ship in mid-flight. At the top right, a similar white line drawing of a stylized human brain with small legs. The overall artistic style is modern, bold, and slightly edgy, balancing a busy, decorative border with a clean, functional message area."
