    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that provides a peaceful conclusion. In the center-left, a small, beautifully detailed watercolor illustration of the whimsical dragon from the front cover is resting on a nearly invisible, ethereal cloud. A few delicate, multi-colored leaves/snowflakes from the front cover are gently drifting down around it. The background is a serene, minimalist wash of the same pale blue and warm gold watercolors used throughout the card, with soft paint bleeds at the edges. The overall feeling is quiet, charming, and subtly humorous. The bottom-right corner area is left completely clear and undecorated.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor scene depicting two charming, cartoon-style characters, inspired by the theme 'thank you for being you.' One character, a woman with flowing dark hair, and the other, a man with short brown hair, are joyfully flying on a majestic, whimsically painted dragon. They are wearing cozy, oversized sweaters and laughing, surrounded by a gentle swirl of autumn leaves transforming into delicate snowflakes, symbolizing the change of seasons. The background is a soft-focus, idyllic park with pale blue and warm gold watercolor washes, seen from above. In the center, the text 'Happy Anniversary' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is soft, flowing watercolor with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds, full-bleed artwork.",
    "leftInterior": "An innovative and playful watercolor illustration that fills the page. It's a cross-section view of an impossibly cozy, fantastical burrow, like a hobbit hole but for food lovers. One side shows a pantry overflowing with giant, whimsical food items: a mountain of colorful macarons, a river of chocolate, and bread loaves shaped like fluffy clouds. The other side reveals a 'gym' area where charmingly illustrated dumbbells are actually croissants and the treadmill is a long licorice stick. The scene is a funny, artistic nod to the diet humor in the message, executed in a beautiful, detailed watercolor style with warm, inviting colors and soft lighting, matching the overall card aesthetic.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and artistic watercolor design elegantly framing the message. The handwritten text is centered, written in a beautiful, clearly readable cursive script. The message is framed by a whimsical, decorative border made of intertwined watercolor illustrations of measuring spoons and whisks that are 'leaking' colorful paint splatters, which transform into tiny, sparkling stars and confetti. The design is playful yet sophisticated, with the same warm gold and soft blue color palette, creating an artistic explosion of joy around the heartfelt, humorous words. The background is a soft, textured watercolor wash. The text reads: 'Jasmine,\\n\\nMerry Christmas! I hope your holiday is filled with more joy and laughter than the number of times we've both promised to start our diets \"in the new year.\" Wishing you all the best, and maybe a few extra cookies!\\n\\nWarmly,\\nJordan'"
