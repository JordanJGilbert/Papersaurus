The scene depicts a laboratory setting with shelves filled with colorful, stylized glass beakers and flasks. Dominating the center is a peculiar, retro-futuristic machine labeled 'THE AGE-STOPPER 3000' emitting bright blue electrical arcs. On the left, a character named Craig, with spiky orange hair and wide, excited eyes, wears a white lab coat and smiles exuberantly. On the right, a character named Jordan, with neat black hair and a mischievous grin, also wears a lab coat and holds a bright orange fire extinguisher. The background is a dark, teal-blue, and the overall mood is humorous and energetic. The text \\\"TO MY FAVORITE GUINEA PIG... I MEAN, FRIEND!\\\" is prominently displayed at the top in large, bold, yellow and white letters with a dark outline.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a flat 2D illustration in a clean, minimalist, and slightly retro cartoon style. The background is a deep, muted teal or petrol blue, with a thin dark grey horizontal line near the bottom of the frame, creating a subtle ground plane. The primary visual element is an electrical plug with its cord, depicted in simple, bold outlines with solid color fills. The plug itself is black, with two bright yellow prongs. A small, stylized white outline of smoke or steam emanates from the top of the plug, and a few tiny yellow sparks radiate from the prongs, indicating it's malfunctioning or \"burnt out.\" A rectangular tag, colored a pale, creamy off-white, is attached to the cord by a thin white line and reads \"AGE-STOPPER 3000\" in bold, black, sans-serif capital letters. The overall composition is simple and humorous, serving as a visual punchline to the greeting card's message. There is no text on this back cover other than the product name on the tag, and no visible space reserved for a QR code. The style is consistent with a humorous, slightly self-deprecating tone, suggesting a device meant to stop aging has failed, which aligns with a funny birthday message.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a flat, 2D blueprint-style illustration. The artwork is a detailed schematic diagram of a fantastical \"AGE-STOPPER 3000\" machine, rendered in a vibrant, luminous teal against a deep navy blue background. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro-futuristic technical drawings or science fiction schematics.\n\nThe design features an intricate network of pipes, wires, gears, and stylized scientific components, all interconnected with precise lines. Key components are labeled with quirky, humorous names in a clean, sans-serif font, such as \"TEMPORAL FLUX CAPACITOR (SLIGHTLY LEAKY)\", \"QUANTUM COIL\", \"TEMPORAL RELAY MODULE\", \"VORTEX OSCILLATOR\", and \"SNACK DISPENSER UNIT\". A central, almost organic-looking apparatus with concentric circles and radiating lines is prominently featured, hinting at the machine's core function.\n\nA stylized clock face, labeled with numbers but with hands positioned to suggest an unusual time, is integrated into one of the \"RELAY MODULES\", adding to the whimsical and time-bending theme. A small, almost cubical \"SNACK DISPENSER UNIT\" at the bottom right contains a circular representation of a cookie, subtly reinforcing the humorous and lighthearted tone.\n\nThe composition is dense and highly detailed, with a full-bleed background that extends to all edges. The lines are crisp and clean, creating a sense of technical precision while the playful labeling and concept of an \"AGE-STOPPER\" inject a strong element of humor and imagination. The color palette is strictly limited to teal and deep navy, creating a cohesive and visually striking monochromatic scheme. There are no people in this illustration, adhering to the \"creative freedom but NO PEOPLE\" directive for the interior pages. The layout is carefully balanced, with the central mechanism drawing the eye, and the labels guiding the viewer through the fantastical \"technology\".",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a futuristic, circuit board aesthetic. The dominant colors are deep navy blue for the background and vibrant electric blue for the graphic elements and text. The background features a subtle, dark grid pattern with faint, abstract technical schematics. A prominent, angular frame, designed to resemble a digital interface or circuit board, encloses the message area. This frame is rendered in thin, bright electric blue lines, featuring nodes, branching paths, and sharp corners. Within the top-left corner of this frame, there is a stylized cogwheel icon. The bottom-right corner of the frame incorporates a simple, outlined flask with two bubbles inside, all in the same electric blue. The text, \"CRAIG, I WAS TOLD TO MAKE THIS A NICE BIRTHDAY CARD, SO... YOU'RE NOT AS OLD AS YOU WILL BE NEXT YEAR. NAILED IT. HOPE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME DAY, BUDDY! JORDAN\", is centered within the frame. The font is a clean, sans-serif typeface, appearing in a slightly lighter shade of electric blue than the frame, ensuring readability against the dark background. The entire composition maintains a flat, 2D illustrative style, with sharp lines and a digital feel. The placement of the text is optimized for clear viewing, with ample space around it within the circuit-board frame, allowing for the potential addition of handwritten notes."
