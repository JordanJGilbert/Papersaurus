    "frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, beautiful botanical illustration, humorous and lighthearted anniversary theme. A funny and charming scene is set on a pretty beach with soft white sand and gentle turquoise waves. In the center, cartoon-illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are sitting on a picnic blanket, having a romantic but comical anniversary dinner. Lao Lao, smiling joyfully, is about to eat a piece of shumai with chopsticks, while Jordan playfully attempts to feed her a piece of kung pao chicken from a takeout container. Surrounding them are several open Chinese food takeout boxes with various dishes like noodles, dumplings, and spring rolls. The entire scene is framed by a lush botanical archway made of tropical leaves, monstera plants, and hibiscus flowers, weaving the beach and botanical themes together. The overall aesthetic is whimsical, bright, and heartwarming.\n\nIn the center of the card, in a clear space above the couple, the text \"Happy Anniversary, my favorite dim sum\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script.\n\nArtwork style: Flat 2D illustration, clean lines, vibrant color palette, matte finish, whimsical and modern.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant greeting card back cover design in a flat 2D illustration style with a matte finish. The background is a solid, soft off-white color, creating a clean and modern feel. In the top-center, there is a small, single, beautifully detailed shumai dumpling, rendered with clean lines and vibrant, yet soft, colors consistent with the front cover's botanical illustration aesthetic. The dumpling is the sole decorative element. The overall composition is very sparse, with ample negative space. The bottom-right quadrant of the card is completely empty to allow for logo or QR code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and subtle greeting card left interior panel, in a flat 2D illustration style. The background is a full-bleed, soft-focus beach scene with gentle turquoise waves meeting soft white sand, echoing the front cover's setting but without any figures or objects. The design features a delicate botanical arrangement in the bottom-left corner, composed of tropical leaves like monstera and hibiscus flowers. The floral elements use a vibrant and heartwarming color palette and are rendered in a clean, modern style. The arrangement covers approximately 35% of the panel, leaving the rest of the beach scene open and serene.",
    "rightInterior": "An elegant greeting card right interior panel designed to beautifully frame a handwritten message. The style is a flat 2D illustration with a matte finish. The background is a solid, soft off-white color providing a large, clear central area for text. A minimalist decorative botanical element, featuring a single hibiscus flower and a small monstera leaf, adorns the bottom-right corner. The artwork is subtle, detailed, and uses the same vibrant, warm color palette as the rest of the card, occupying no more than 15% of the total space. The design is clean, sophisticated, and focuses on creating an inviting space for a personal note.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my dearest Lao Lao,\n\nHappy 2 Year Anniversary! They say the first two years are the hardest, but I think the hardest part has been pretending I'm not the luckiest person in the world. Thanks for not getting tired of me yet; I promise to keep things weird and interesting for many more years to come.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
