The scene depicts a sun-drenched San Francisco street with iconic Victorian houses lining the upper left and right sides. A winding road, lined with vibrant orange poppies, leads the eye towards a hazy, distant view of the Golden Gate Bridge under a pale blue and yellow sky. A single monarch butterfly flutters in the upper right corner. The text \\\"To June, Dan, Paul, Andrew, & Bryce\\\" is written in an elegant, legible dark brown cursive script, positioned in the upper-middle section of the card, well within safe printing margins. The overall mood is warm, inviting, and heartfelt, with gentle brushstrokes and subtle paper texture evident.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card in a 9:16 ratio, painted in a soft watercolor style, continuing the San Francisco theme with a sense of peaceful resolution.

The background is a softly blurred wash of blues and greens, suggesting lush foliage and a serene atmosphere.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a thank-you card with a delicate, minimalist watercolor style. The background is a soft, creamy off-white with a subtle paper texture. Dominating the upper left quadrant is a single, beautifully rendered monarch butterfly wing, its vibrant orange and black patterns captured with soft, bleeding watercolor brushstrokes. Trailing downwards from the wing, scattered and slightly decreasing in size, are four delicate, abstract shapes that appear to be falling petals or perhaps fragments of the butterfly's essence, rendered in the same warm orange watercolor as the wing. These elements are artfully placed to fill the composition without being overly dense, leaving ample negative space that contributes to the serene and heartfelt tone. There is no text on this back cover, and the composition is intentionally sparse, with the main visual elements focused on the upper left and center, leaving the bottom right corner (approximately 1 inch square) entirely clear and undecorated, ideal for a QR code placement. The overall design offers a peaceful, understated resolution, subtly echoing the butterfly motif from the implied front and interior of the card.\n\nStyle: watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",

The textured paper shows subtle watercolor blooms and organic paint bleeds, creating a soft, diffused effect. Within the orange sections, a delicate, out-of-focus pattern of tiny, bright orange flowers suggests a sun-drenched meadow. The composition is layered and dynamic, with sweeping black lines defining the wing segments, creating a sense of depth and movement. The overall impression is warm, sunny, and organic, evoking the feeling of being immersed in nature and the beauty of San Francisco. The style is flat 2D artwork for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds. The artistic techniques include loose watercolor washes, defined ink-like outlines for the wing veins, and a soft dappled texture for the floral elements. The color palette is dominated by warm oranges, yellows, and deep blacks, with subtle hints of blue and green in the background. There is no text present on this interior page. The layout is abstract and decorative, filling the entire page with the swirling patterns of the butterfly wings.",
