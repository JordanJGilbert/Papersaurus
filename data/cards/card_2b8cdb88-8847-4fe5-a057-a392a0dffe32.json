    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that provides a peaceful conclusion. In the center-left of the card, a delicate watercolor illustration of a single stork feather slowly drifts downwards, leaving a faint trail of pastel-colored sparkles behind it. The feather is rendered with soft edges and translucent watercolor layers. The background is a soft, pale wash of color from the main palette, with subtle paper texture. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty. The overall feeling is serene, minimalist, and artistic, subtly referencing the front cover's theme in a quiet, beautiful way.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor scene. A cartoon baby girl with a mischievous grin, wearing a party hat, is shown 'directing' a stork who is flying towards a calendar. The stork, looking slightly frazzled, is carrying a bundle. Both are pointing towards the same date on the calendar, which is circled with a big, sparkly heart. Above them, a stylized cartoon grandmother with short grey hair and glasses looks on from a fluffy cloud, laughing heartily with a knowing smile. The background is a soft, dreamy sky with pastel watercolor clouds. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday to the stars of the show!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is a whimsical watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, creating a funny and heartwarming opening.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An artistic and unexpected watercolor illustration that continues the lighthearted theme. The entire page depicts a close-up, whimsical 'conspiracy board' or 'master plan'. It features a large, playfully drawn blueprint of a calendar with arrows, doodles, and notes connecting the shared birthday date to things like 'Operation: Grandmacuddle,' 'Mission: Double Cake,' and 'Phase 3: Synchronized Wish-Making.' Fun, silly diagrams of party hats, balloons, and sparklers are scattered around like important tactical elements. The whole piece is rendered in a soft, funny, hand-drawn watercolor style, as if a brilliant baby strategist planned it all, maintaining the card's humorous and loving tone.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design focusing on the message. The handwritten text is framed by an innovative and decorative border. Two intertwined, whimsical party horns, one slightly larger and more ornate (grandmother's) and one smaller and cuter (granddaughter's), arc gracefully around the message area. They are decorated with delicate watercolor patterns and release a gentle cascade of soft, pastel-colored confetti and tiny, sparkling stars that float around the text. The background is a soft, clean watercolor wash. The message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are! Love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\"."
