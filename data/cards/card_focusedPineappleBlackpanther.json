    "frontCover": "Here is the detailed image generation prompt for the front cover:\n\nFront cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a charming watercolor illustration. The scene depicts a serene beach at twilight, with the sky transitioning from a soft pink and orange glow near the horizon to a deep indigo speckled with numerous small white stars and dotted lines forming constellations. A stylized house constellation is visible in the upper left, and a playful fish constellation is in the upper right. In the mid-ground, two silhouetted palm trees stand against the colorful sky. In the foreground, a young girl with dark hair, wearing a red outfit and a red flower behind her ear, sits on a sandy beach, looking upwards towards the stars with a sense of wonder. The sand has a textured, warm brown appearance. The words \"Thank you\" are written in elegant, flowing golden cursive script, positioned in the upper center of the image, clearly readable and artistically integrated. Below the girl, also in golden cursive, are the words \"little mel\". The overall mood is heartfelt and magical, with soft, blended watercolor brushstrokes and a warm, inviting color palette. The artwork is flat 2D, with a full-bleed background.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a celestial, starry night sky transitioning from deep indigo at the top to a soft lavender and pale pink at the bottom, rendered in a watercolor painting style.

The overall aesthetic is serene and magical, suggesting a peaceful resolution to a dreamlike journey. The design is minimalist and evocative, with no text or additional decorative elements, allowing for a clear space for a QR code in the bottom right corner. The artistic style uses soft, blended brushstrokes and a subtle paper texture, maintaining visual continuity with the whimsical, heartfelt theme of dreams and aspirations.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dreamlike, watercolor aesthetic. The scene depicts a stylized night sky filled with subtle, abstract watercolor clouds in deep blues and muted golds. A delicate, illuminated constellation, formed by thin yellow lines connecting glowing yellow dots, weaves across the sky. Below the sky, silhouetted against the cosmic backdrop, are three distinct architectural elements: on the left, a tall, narrow house with visible window panes; in the center, a slightly wider building with arched windows; and on the right, a more distant, open-porch style house with warmly lit windows, hinting at a tropical locale with a faint palm frond silhouette. In the lower portion of the image, the faint outlines of a city skyline are visible, transitioning into a textured expanse of deep teal and blue, suggesting water. The overall impression is one of aspiration and interconnectedness, with the constellation acting as a symbolic bridge between different dreams and locations. The watercolor technique is evident in the soft blending of colors, visible brushstrokes, and slight paper texture, creating an ethereal and heartfelt mood. The 9:16 aspect ratio is maintained.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with watercolor textures and a serene underwater theme. The background features soft, blended washes of turquoise and aqua, creating the illusion of tranquil water with subtle hints of lighter tones and faint white specks suggesting light play or bubbles. Dominating the upper two-thirds of the page are stylized, golden-yellow musical notes and wavy lines that resemble musical staves, interspersed with charming, stylized yellow sea turtles and schools of matching yellow fish swimming along these musical currents. These elements are depicted with loose, expressive watercolor brushstrokes and soft, organic paint bleeds, creating a sense of gentle movement. Below the musical elements, the message \"Sing your true song\\nMele\" is beautifully rendered in a flowing, deep blue cursive script, mimicking elegant handwriting. The script is clear, readable, and imbued with a warm, personal touch, with natural variations in line weight that suggest a pen with ink flow.
