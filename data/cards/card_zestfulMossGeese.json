    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a dark navy blue background. At the top, centered, is the text \"THANK YOU â€¢ AI FOR GOOD CONFERENCE\" in a thin, sans-serif yellow font. Below this, prominently centered, is \"JESSICA GREENWALT\" in a larger, glowing white sans-serif font, with \"JESSICA\" on the first line and \"GREENWALT\" on the second. From the bottom center, a stylized, abstract tree-like structure emerges, composed of thin, glowing lines in teal, gold, magenta, and a darker pink. These lines branch upwards and outwards, forming various simple iconographic elements: a human figure icon, a globe icon, a leaf icon (repeated several times), a heart icon (repeated twice), and a stylized microchip icon. The lines are clean and modern, with a flat 2D aesthetic. The overall mood is sophisticated, inspirational, and subtly tech-focused. The style is minimalist vector art with a neon glow effect on the lines against a flat background.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a dark navy blue background. In the bottom right corner, a square QR code is prominently displayed within a subtle gold border, making it easily scannable. Below the QR code, the text \"View & Share Online\" is presented in a clean, modern, and understated white font. Centered slightly above and to the left of the QR code, a delicate, thin, glowing blue-green line curves upwards from the bottom edge, branching into three finer tendrils that reach towards the top center of the card. At the base of these tendrils, a stylized, abstract, luminous shape resembling a seed or a petal glows with soft, iridescent hues of pink, yellow, and blue. This visual element is minimalist and abstract, representing the blooming of ideas and progress, harmoniously concluding the visual narrative with a sense of quiet inspiration. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and sophisticated, with a focus on subtle illumination against a dark, calming backdrop. The design maintains the inspirational and uplifting tone, providing a peaceful resolution.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a dark blue, almost black, background. The artwork features a stylized, abstract representation of interconnected lines and data flow. Thin, luminous lines in shades of bright cyan, warm yellow, and vibrant magenta originate from the left side of the image, curving and converging towards the right. These lines are not straight but have a gentle, flowing, organic S-curve, with small, glowing dots at their starting points on the left, symbolizing the introduction of diverse ideas or contributions. As the lines move towards the right, they become more parallel and concentrated, forming a bright, luminous beam of light with a subtle gradient of colors (similar to the originating lines, but more blended and intense), signifying the culmination and amplification of these ideas into a powerful, unified force for good. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and sophisticated, with a subtle glow effect on the lines and dots. The style is flat 2D vector art with a focus on smooth curves and vibrant, contrasting colors against a dark background, creating a sense of energy and forward momentum. The composition is balanced, with the visual weight and focus shifting from left to right, implying progress and development. There is no text present on this page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a dark, sophisticated background. The left two-thirds of the space are intentionally left open for handwritten messages. Emerging from the right side of the card, a stylized, abstract representation of interconnected circuits and data streams forms a dynamic visual element. These lines are primarily rendered in glowing shades of electric blue and warm amber, with occasional small, scattered blue and orange dots representing nodes or data points. At the core of this visual motif, a bright, pulsating orange-gold sphere acts as a central hub, emanating light and energy outwards through the circuit lines. The overall aesthetic is sleek, modern, and technological, evoking a sense of intelligent connection and forward-thinking progress. The \"Smart Style\" is characterized by its clean lines, geometric precision, and subtle glowing effects against the dark backdrop. The tone is inspirational, suggesting innovation and a bright future through technology. The circuit design is an extension of the theme of \"AI for Good,\" symbolizing the complex yet hopeful pathways of technological advancement and collaboration. There are no people or characters present in this design, adhering to the prompt's requirements. The focus is on the abstract representation of connectivity and progress."
