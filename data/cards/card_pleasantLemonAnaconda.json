    "backCover": "A serene and minimalist flat 2D anime-style illustration continuing the enchanted forest theme. The background is a soft, full-bleed gradient of mint green and lavender, matching the front cover's pastel palette. In the upper-left quadrant, a single, elegant, sparkling mushroom with a glowing cap gently illuminates its surroundings. A few delicate, floating pixie dust motes drift lazily across the top half of the card. The overall composition is peaceful and uncluttered, with a dreamy, magical atmosphere. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1x1 inch, is intentionally left completely blank and undecorated, with a solid, light pastel background for QR code placement.",
    "frontCover": "A charming and whimsical flat 2D anime-style illustration of John, depicted as a slightly clumsy but happy gnome with a fluffy white beard and a pointy red hat, attempting to ride a giant, fluffy, magical snail. The snail, decorated with intricate glowing patterns on its shell, looks comically unimpressed and is slowly munching on a sparkling, oversized mushroom. The scene is set in an enchanted forest with towering, luminous flora, floating pixie dust motes, and soft pastel-colored foliage in shades of mint green, lavender, and peach. In the center of the image, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are elegantly written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, rendered in a warm, glowing gold color. The overall atmosphere is dreamy, magical, and lightheartedly humorous.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful full-bleed decorative artwork in a flat 2D anime style, visually harmonious with the front cover. The design features an intricate, glowing pattern reminiscent of the magical snail's shell from the front cover, rendered in warm gold and soft lavender hues. This elegant pattern swirls gracefully from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right, set against a dreamy background of pastel mint green and peach. The artwork is accented with soft, luminous flora and floating pixie dust motes, creating a magical and enchanting atmosphere without any characters or faces.",
    "rightInterior": "A decorative flat 2D anime-style illustration serving as a backdrop for the message. The background is a soft blend of the enchanted forest's pastel colors: mint green, lavender, and peach. Delicate, luminous vines with small, glowing flowers gracefully frame the central area of the card, spiraling in from the top-left and bottom-right corners, ensuring they do not obscure the text. Floating pixie dust motes add a touch of magic. In the center, safely positioned away from all edges, the following message is rendered in a beautiful, elegant, and exceptionally clear handwritten cursive script, using a dark, high-contrast color like a deep indigo or charcoal for maximum legibility: \"John,\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered I have to see you every day and I value my safety. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\n\nAll the best,\nLauren\""
