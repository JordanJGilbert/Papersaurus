    "frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous full-bleed watercolor illustration featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan. The characters are rendered in a charming, flat 2D style with soft, flowing colors and visible paper texture, resembling a watercolor painting.\n\nThe scene is set against a soft, light cream-colored background with subtle watercolor splotches. Jordan, on the right, is illustrated to look like the man in the photo, with his distinct joyful smile, tousled dark hair, and wearing a simple white t-shirt. He is playfully and lovingly presenting Lao Lao with a giant, steaming bowl of Chinese porridge, so large it takes both his hands to hold.\n\nLao Lao, on the left, is an adorable cartoon version of the woman in the photo, capturing her sweet smile, long dark hair, and round glasses. She is wearing the same yellow floral halter dress. Her eyes are wide with delight and she's laughing, reaching out with one hand towards the giant porridge. In her other hand, she is happily holding a tall glass of boba tea, complete with tapioca pearls visible at the bottom.\n\nFloating around them like festive balloons are cute, plump watercolor dumplings with smiling faces, tied with little strings. Some dumplings are bobbing near the top, while others are scattered around the couple, adding to the fun, celebratory atmosphere.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned between the couple and slightly above the porridge bowl, is the greeting text in a beautiful, flowing, dark brown handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday to my Dumpling, Lao Lao\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover design in a flat 2D watercolor painting style. The background is a full-bleed, soft light cream color with a visible paper texture and subtle, organic watercolor splotches in warm yellows and soft browns. In the upper-left corner, there is a small, simple, artistic cluster of two plump, smiling watercolor dumplings, rendered with soft flowing colors and delicate linework, without strings. The design is very clean, occupying about 20% of the space, leaving the rest of the cream background empty, especially the bottom-right corner for branding or a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, decorative full-bleed illustration for the left interior panel of a greeting card. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors and a visible paper texture. The background is a continuation of the soft, light cream color. A cascade of whimsical watercolor dumplings gently floats down from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right. The dumplings are plump and feature simple, sweet smiling faces, tied with delicate dark brown strings, bobbing as if they were balloons. The colors are soft yellows, warm browns, and creams, with artistic brush strokes and organic paint bleeds. This decorative element fills approximately 40% of the panel, creating a charming and festive yet uncluttered feel.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist and elegant design for the right interior panel, intended to frame a personal message. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with a full-bleed, soft light cream background featuring visible paper texture. A single, tall glass of boba tea is illustrated in the bottom-left corner. The glass is rendered with soft, artistic brush strokes, showing layers of creamy tea and dark tapioca pearls at the bottom. This decorative element is subtle and occupies about 20% of the space, leaving a large, clean area in the center and right for handwritten text. The overall aesthetic is clean, warm, and inviting, perfectly complementing the rest of the card's design.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my dearest Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I love you more than you love boba tea, which is saying a lot. You're the perfect filling to my dumpling, and my world would be as plain as porridge without you. Hope your day is as sweet as you are!\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
