    "backCover": "A simple and elegant decorative design on a soft pastel teal background, providing a peaceful conclusion to the card's story. From the left side of the card, a single, elegant silver ribbon playfully curls and loops towards the center, as if it's the leftover ribbon from the giant gift on the front. A few scattered pieces of gold and pink confetti from the front cover float gently around the ribbon. The design is minimalist and artistic, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. The overall feeling is serene, clean, and subtly connected to the main theme.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming flat 2D illustration for a birthday card. The scene features a stylized cartoon boyfriend character, representing Jordan, standing proudly next to a gigantic, ornately wrapped gift box that takes up most of the frame. He has a smug, playful grin on his face. The gift box is wrapped in shimmering gold paper with a ridiculously large, floppy silver bow. The background is a soft pastel teal, filled with subtle, floating confetti in shades of gold, silver, and pink. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The art style is clean, with defined lines and a modern, whimsical feel. The overall mood is funny, celebratory, and full of personality.",
    "leftInterior": "A striking and humorous full-bleed 2D illustration. The scene depicts the giant, ornately wrapped gift box from the front cover, but now it's dramatically bursting open like a jack-in-the-box. Instead of a gift, a massive, comical, golden trophy emerges, emblazoned with the words '#1 Boyfriend'. Beams of light and celebratory confetti in gold, silver, and pink explode from the box, filling the soft pastel teal background. The artwork is dynamic and funny, creating a visual punchline to the setup on the front cover. The style is flat, graphic, and consistent with the rest of the card.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed space for the message, set against the same soft pastel teal background. The handwritten message is the centerpiece, written in an elegant, legible, and personal cursive script. The text is framed by an artistic, humorous illustration: the giant golden '#1 Boyfriend' trophy from the left interior is now positioned to the left of the text, tilted slightly with a comical sparkle. A few strands of the shiny silver ribbon from the gift box elegantly swirl around the top and bottom corners of the text area, tying the whole design together. The composition feels balanced, sophisticated, and funny, perfectly complementing the message. The message reads: 'Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a super expensive gift, but then I remembered having me as your boyfriend is the greatest gift of all. You're welcome! I hope you have a day that's as amazing as you are. Love, Jordan'."
