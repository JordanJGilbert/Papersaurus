    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor greeting card front for Carl. A cartoon illustrated man, based on the reference photo, is wearing a party hat and comically struggling to blow out a single, very stubborn, magical birthday candle on a tiny cupcake he's holding. The candle flame is playfully dodging his puffs of air, leaving little smoke trails in whimsical shapes. The man has an exaggerated, puffed-out-cheeks expression. In the background, soft, celebratory confetti floats down. Centered in a safe area, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The entire scene is a flat 2D artwork in a vibrant watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A simple and elegant back cover for a greeting card. The design features a single, unlit, magical birthday candle from the front cover, standing upright in a small dollop of frosting in the upper-left corner. A few pieces of soft, celebratory confetti are scattered delicately around the top of the card, seeming to float down. The background is a clean, flat 2D design in a vibrant watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, matching the front cover. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left blank and undecorated for QR code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful decorative interior for a greeting card. The design is an abstract full-bleed background featuring soft, celebratory confetti playfully cascading down from the top corners, leaving plenty of open space in the center. The artwork is in a vibrant watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, perfectly matching the style and mood of the front cover. The design is purely decorative, with no text or characters.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful decorative interior for a greeting card. The design features the message beautifully integrated with artistic elements. The message 'Carl,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered that I'm not that far behind you. Let's just agree we're both aging like fine wine... that's been left out on the counter a little too long.\n\nHope you have a great day!\n- Jordan' is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The text is framed by whimsical trails of smoke and soft, celebratory confetti drifting from the top-left and bottom-right corners. The artwork is a flat 2D full-bleed design in a vibrant watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, maintaining visual consistency with the front cover. No characters are present."
