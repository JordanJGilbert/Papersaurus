    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a warm, slightly stylized illustration. The artistic style is a blend of digital painting with a watercolor texture, featuring soft edges and visible brushstroke effects. The color palette is dominated by warm, earthy tones, including various shades of brown, beige, olive green, and muted blues and yellows in the background and on the canvas.\n\nThe main subjects are three figures: on the left, an older man with glasses and a green cap; in the center, a golden retriever dog wearing a beret and a paint-splattered smock; and on the right, a younger man in a navy blue t-shirt. The man on the left holds a white sign with black text that reads \"HAROLD M\". The dog is holding paintbrushes in its mouth and in its paws, with one brush poised over a colorful, abstract painting on an easel behind it. The painting on the easel contains splashes of blue, green, and orange, with paw prints visible. The younger man on the right holds a white sign with black text that reads \"START X 2025\". Both men are looking towards the viewer with friendly expressions. In the background, there is a framed picture of a dog.\n\nThe text \"Happy Birthday Jordan\" is prominently displayed at the top of the card in a flowing, cursive font with a dark brown color. The background has a subtle pattern of faint, repeated dog-related icons, such as paw prints and dog houses, on a light beige surface.\n\nThe layout is centered and balanced, with the figures arranged in a pleasing composition around the easel. The overall mood is cheerful, familial, and celebratory, with a touch of artistic flair, fitting for a birthday card.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a watercolor artistic style. The background is a soft, textured parchment color with subtle, faded watercolor washes in beige and light brown, suggesting aged paper. A trail of four watercolor paw prints descends from the upper left corner towards the bottom right, colored in muted shades of blue, green, yellow, and orange. In the lower right portion of the image, a wooden paintbrush with silver ferrule rests on a vibrant, abstract watercolor splotch featuring a blend of red, orange, yellow, blue, and green pigments, with the brush tip dipping into the colors. The composition is minimalist, with ample negative space, and there is no visible QR code. The overall design evokes a playful, creative, and organic feel, subtly tying into the \"I love dogs\" theme by depicting the act of creating art with dog-related imagery.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a gentle watercolor wash background in creamy beige and soft, muted brown tones, creating an aged paper texture. On the left side, a diagonal trail of four stylized paw prints descends from the top left corner towards the bottom center. The paw prints are rendered in watercolor, with the top one in a soft blue, followed by green, yellow-green, and finally a vibrant orange at the bottom. To the right of the paw print trail, near the bottom right, a wooden paintbrush with a silver ferrule rests on a vibrant, multicolored watercolor puddle. The puddle contains swirling blends of red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. The brush itself is depicted with a warm brown handle, angled downwards into the paint, with its bristles softly blended into the colorful puddle. The overall composition is clean and spacious, with the imagery concentrated in the lower left and bottom right, leaving ample white space at the top for a handwritten message, complementing the theme of a creative, dog-loving birthday. The artistic style is soft, painterly watercolor with visible brushstrokes and subtle color blending.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a light cream background featuring a subtle, repeating pattern of dog paws and dog houses. The upper portion of the page has the printed greeting \"Happy Birthday Jordan\" in a playful, calligraphic brown font. Below the greeting, the design depicts three characters: an older man in a green jacket and baseball cap on the left, a golden retriever wearing a beret and smock in the center, and a young man in a dark blue t-shirt on the right. They are all positioned in front of an easel with a colorful, abstract painting that includes paw prints. The older man holds a sign with \"HAROLD M\" written on it, and the younger man holds a sign that reads \"START X 2025\". The overall artistic style is a warm, watercolor illustration with soft textures and a friendly, whimsical feel. The visual elements are arranged to leave significant open space in the center and lower portions of the card for handwritten messages."
