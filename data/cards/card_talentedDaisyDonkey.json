    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a watercolor artistic style. The color palette is warm and inviting, dominated by shades of yellow, orange, and red, with touches of green and purple. The main subjects are two cartoon characters, a young boy with dark curly hair and glasses, wearing a green shirt, and an older person with grey hair, wearing a purple shirt. They are sitting at a table, with the boy offering a french fry to the older person, who is reaching for it and smiling broadly from a basket of french fries. In front of the boy is a heart-shaped pepperoni pizza. The text \"I Love You More Than Pizza\" is displayed prominently at the top in a flowing, dark brown script font. At the bottom of the card, the names \"Jordan\" and \"Lao Lao\" are written in a simpler, dark brown sans-serif font, with \"Jordan\" on the left and \"Lao Lao\" on the right. The composition is centered and balanced, creating a cozy and affectionate mood. The background features soft watercolor washes in warm tones, suggesting a warm and comforting atmosphere, possibly a dining setting.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor artistic style, featuring a single, thick, golden-yellow french fry standing vertically and slightly tilted, casting a soft, subtle shadow on a textured, light beige background with a gentle watercolor wash that creates subtle color variations and soft edges. A small, reddish-pink heart shape is positioned to the upper right of the french fry. The overall aesthetic is minimalist and charming, providing a sweet and simple closing visual to the card's story. There is ample negative space, suitable for potential placement of a QR code or small text elements, but no such elements are present in the current design. The composition is balanced with the main elements placed off-center, creating a casual yet deliberate feel.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a whimsical greeting card with a watercolor illustration of a pizza-shaped rocket soaring through a starry night sky. The rocket is depicted as a bright yellow pizza crust base with round, red pepperoni toppings, and it has stylized orange fins. Emanating from the rocket's base is a stream of yellow and orange watercolor brushstrokes resembling pizza fries or cheese strands as exhaust. The background is a rich, textured wash of deep blues, purples, and hints of pink and yellow, evoking a cosmic nebula effect. Scattered white dots represent distant stars, and several swirling, creamy yellow and white galaxy-like patterns are visible, reminiscent of Van Gogh's Starry Night. Three small, reddish-orange circular shapes, perhaps planets or distant pepperoni moons, are strategically placed around the rocket. The overall artistic style is loose, expressive, and painterly, with visible watercolor textures, bleeding colors, and soft edges. The composition is dynamic, with the rocket angled upwards and to the left, creating a sense of forward movement and adventure. The color palette is warm and inviting, with the dominant blues of space contrasting beautifully with the fiery oranges and yellows of the pizza rocket and its exhaust. There is no visible text or typography.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical, hand-drawn watercolor style. The background is a soft, pale cream or parchment color. The entire page is framed by a decorative border composed of golden-yellow french fries and small, deep red, slightly textured hearts scattered throughout. The french fries are depicted in a playful, scattered arrangement, with some appearing to spill out of stylized red paper fry containers positioned at the bottom left and bottom right corners. The hearts are also randomly placed, interspersed with the fries, some appearing to be floating or falling. The central area is left largely open, creating ample space for a handwritten message. The printed text, \"Lao Lao,\" is written in an elegant, flowing black script at the top center. The rest of the printed message, including the closing \"All my love, Jordan,\" is also in the same black script, appearing naturally handwritten and centered within the open message area. The overall aesthetic balances the fun, food-themed illustrations with a clear intention of providing a personal writing space."
