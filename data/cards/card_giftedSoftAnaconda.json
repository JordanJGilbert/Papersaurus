    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card with a playful, cartoonish illustration. The art style is flat 2D with bold outlines and solid color fills, reminiscent of a modern animation or a stylized children's book. The color palette is bright and cheerful, dominated by a clear, light blue sky, vibrant green rolling hills, and the warm, natural wood tones of a catapult.\n\nDominating the center of the image is a wooden catapult, depicted with a thick, sturdy frame, large wooden wheels, and a projectile cradle holding a large, grey stone. The catapult is positioned on a grassy hill, with stylized, short dashes of darker green representing grass. In the background, a modern, glass-domed building, resembling a greenhouse or a futuristic observatory, is perched atop another rolling hill. A single, bright starburst emanates from the peak of this building. Two stylized, fluffy white clouds float in the sky to the left of the frame.\n\nThe text \"Happy Birthday!\" is prominently displayed at the top of the card in a bold, sans-serif black font. The text is centered and positioned well within safe printing margins, avoiding the very top and bottom edges. The overall mood is lighthearted, slightly quirky, and celebratory, with a humorous undertone implied by the presence of the catapult.\n\nGiven the context of a chronological story for a birthday card, this front cover sets an unexpected and humorous scene, perhaps alluding to \"launching\" good wishes or celebrating with a bang, establishing a unique visual narrative.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 aspect ratio, in a bold, flat 2D cartoon illustration style. A bright, clear light blue sky with two stylized, fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, rolling green hills with short, dark green grass marks. Centered on the hills is a wooden catapult with a thick frame, large wooden wheels with grey circular accents, and a cradle holding a large grey stone. Behind the catapult, on a higher hill, sits a modern, geometric glass-domed building with a starburst shining from its peak. The text \\\"Happy Birthday!\\\" is in a bold, black, sans-serif font, centered at the top of the card, with ample clearance from the top and bottom edges. The overall mood is whimsical, humorous, and inviting.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 aspect ratio, continuing the flat 2D cartoon illustration style. The background is a soft, gradient wash of light blue transitioning to a pale green at the bottom, evoking a gentle sky and ground. In the lower third, a single, stylized, rolling green hill mirrors the foreground of the front cover. At the peak of this hill, a small, minimalist outline of the glass-domed building from the front cover is subtly placed, with a tiny, faint starburst. Scattered across the green hill are a few small, stylized dashes of darker green grass. The overall design is serene and minimalist, providing a quiet conclusion that references the front cover without text or characters.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior page of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 aspect ratio, continuing the flat 2D cartoon illustration style and color palette. A rolling green landscape fills the bottom half of the image. The sky above is a clear, light blue, but instead of clouds, it features a repeating, whimsical pattern of small, stylized bouncing grey stones, reminiscent of the projectile from the catapult on the front cover. These stones are scattered across the sky in a playful, energetic arrangement. The overall mood is lighthearted and continues the unexpected theme of the card, implying motion or anticipation in a humorous way.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior page of a birthday greeting card, 9:16 aspect ratio, in a flat 2D cartoon illustration style with bold outlines and solid colors. The background is a light blue sky with a few soft, white stylized clouds. The main focus is the prominent display of the message: \\\"Craig,\\n\\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered my own age and decided not to throw stones from my glass house. Hope you have a fantastic day!\\n\\nYour slightly-less-old friend,\\nJordan\\\". The text is presented in a clear, readable black sans-serif font, centered and with safe margins from all edges. The text is artfully integrated with a subtle visual element: a stylized, simplified outline of the wooden catapult arm, with its cradle, is positioned diagonally behind and around the text, as if it's about to launch the message. The catapult arm is in wood tones, and the stone is a simple grey circle within the cradle. The overall composition frames the message with the card's central motif in a humorous and creative manner.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a simple, humorous, and slightly absurd illustration. The artwork features a minimalist, flat 2D style with thick black outlines and solid color fills. The background is a pale, creamy yellow, reminiscent of aged paper. In the lower half of the image, a gently sloping green hill occupies the bottom portion, creating a ground plane. Centered on this hill is a crude, wooden trebuchet made of thick, brown planks. The trebuchet has a large, spoon-like launching arm positioned upwards, ready to deploy. The overall impression is one of playful, unrefined construction. There is no text, and no space is reserved for QR codes.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a flat 2D illustration in a \"Smart Style\" reminiscent of graphic illustration with bold lines and flat color areas. The scene depicts a simplified, geometric greenhouse structure against a deep blue sky. The greenhouse features a dark blue or black frame with large panes of glass. Sunlight is casting strong, diagonal shadows across the glass panes, creating a pattern of alternating blue and creamy off-white stripes. Two stylized, fluffy white clouds are visible in the upper corners of the deep blue sky. The composition is focused on the architectural form of the greenhouse and the interplay of light and shadow, with no text or characters present. The color palette is limited to deep blue, creamy off-white, and dark blue/black for the frame. The overall tone is clean, modern, and graphic, with a slightly dramatic feel due to the strong shadows.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a light blue background. The text \"Craig, Happy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered my own age and decided not to throw stones from my glass house. Hope you have a fantastic day! Your slightly-less-old friend, Jordan\" is presented in a clear, sans-serif font, centrally aligned. The artistic elements are confined to the four corners of the page, each featuring a stylized, dark blue graphic that resembles a cracked or fractured glass pane. These corner elements are abstract and graphic, not illustrative of any specific object or scene, and are intentionally placed to frame the message without overwhelming it. The overall aesthetic is minimalist and modern, using a limited color palette of light blue and dark blue. The design prioritizes readability and the presentation of the message, with the corner graphics adding a subtle, graphic motif."
