    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor painting that complements the front cover. The design features a few delicate, soft-focus fireworks blooming gently in the top left corner, echoing the festive theme. The majority of the card is a soft, textured watercolor wash in pale blues and pinks, suggestive of a twilight sky. A single, stylized watercolor silhouette of the rollercoaster track from the front cover loops gracefully across the bottom third of the design. The artistic style is soft and flowing, with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1x1 inch, is left completely blank and unadorned for QR code placement. No people or text.",
    "frontCover": "**Front Cover Prompt:**\n\nFlat 2D watercolor painting of a funny, lighthearted scene featuring two stylized cartoon characters, \"Lao Lao\" and \"Jordan,\" based on the provided reference photo. The setting combines elements of the Fourth of July and an amusement park. Jordan is comically trying to hold a giant, melting red-white-and-blue popsicle in one hand and a huge fluffy pink cotton candy in the other, with a look of joyful panic. Lao Lao is laughing beside him, holding onto his arm to steady herself, possibly pointing at a massive rollercoaster looming in the background. The rollercoaster has a cart with two empty seats at the very peak of its highest drop. In the sky above, whimsical watercolor fireworks are blooming in soft, festive colors. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Thank you for being the best\".\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, decorative watercolor painting serving as a full-bleed background. The artwork features an abstract pattern inspired by the elements on the front cover.

    "rightInterior": "A decorative watercolor background that harmonizes with the overall card design. The background is a soft, textured wash of pale blues and pinks. A few whimsical, soft-focus watercolor firework bursts decorate the top and bottom corners, framing the space. Centered on the page, the following message is written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script: \"Lao Lao, thanks for an amazing summer! I'm still not sure what was more explosive, the Fourth of July fireworks or my stomach after all those rollercoasters at the amusement park. Honestly, surviving both with you officially makes you the best girlfriend ever.\\n\\nAll my love,\\nJordan\". The artwork and text are rendered in the same soft, flowing watercolor style with visible artistic brush strokes and organic paint bleeds. The text and key design elements are positioned at least 0.5 inches from the left and right edges and 10% from the top and bottom edges. No people or characters."
