    "frontCover": "A vibrant and funny watercolor painting for a greeting card front. The scene is a whimsical, snowy mountain peak under a bright blue sky. In the center, Jordan and Lao Lao, depicted as charming cartoon watercolor versions of themselves based on the reference photo, are celebrating. Jordan is hilariously mid-air, launching off a snowy ramp on his snowboard, which is cleverly made of a giant hot dog in a bun. He has a wide, excited grin. Lao Lao is at the bottom of the ramp, laughing and cheering, holding up a birthday cupcake with a single lit candle as if it's a trophy.\n\nThe snowy landscape is playfully decorated with food items: pine trees are shaped like stylized grilled steaks and sausages, and fluffy white snowdrifts are dotted with colorful birthday cupcakes like festive bushes. The overall style is soft-edged watercolor with beautiful color bleeds and a lighthearted, hand-painted feel.\n\nIn the center of the sky, in a beautiful, flowing handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\". The composition is dynamic and full of joy. Flat 2D artwork style for printing.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant watercolor painting for a greeting card back cover. The background is a solid, soft off-white with a subtle paper texture. In the upper-left corner, there is a small, charming, and simple emblem featuring a stylized snowboard crossed with a grilled sausage, rendered in the same whimsical watercolor style as the front cover. The colors are muted but consistent with the card's palette. The emblem is small, occupying about 20% of the top left area. The rest of the card, especially the bottom-right corner, is left clean and blank. Flat 2D artwork style for printing, with organic paint bleeds and soft flowing colors.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative watercolor painting for the left interior of a greeting card. The entire panel is filled with a dynamic, full-bleed pattern background. The pattern consists of small, scattered, whimsical illustrations of cupcakes, stylized grilled steaks, and hot dogs arranged playfully against a soft, light blue watercolor wash background that mimics a clear sky. The illustrations are rendered in a charming, hand-painted style with soft edges and beautiful color bleeds, creating a subtle yet festive atmosphere. The overall visual density is around 40%, leaving plenty of negative space between elements. No text. Flat 2D artwork style for printing.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor painting for the right interior of a greeting card, designed to frame a message area. The background is a clean, off-white with a subtle paper texture. A decorative border adorns the bottom edge of the card, featuring a gentle, snowy ground line rendered in soft white and light blue watercolors. A few colorful, stylized birthday cupcakes are nestled in the snow along this bottom border, similar to the bushes on the front cover. This decorative element is minimal, taking up about 20% of the space at the bottom, leaving the upper 80% of the panel open and clear for a handwritten message. The style is soft and artistic with organic paint bleeds. Flat 2D artwork style for printing.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Hey Jordan,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to list all the reasons I love you, but then I realized there wouldn't be enough room on this card for all your amazing qualities. Plus, I know you're really just here for my long legs, tiny toes, and terrible jokes, and luckily for you, you're stuck with all three for another year!\n\nAll my love,\nLao Lao\""
