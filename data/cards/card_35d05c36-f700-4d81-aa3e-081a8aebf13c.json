    "backCover": "A simple and serene watercolor painting providing a peaceful conclusion. On the left side of the card, the giant red ribbon from the front cover is shown lying empty and untied on a patch of soft green grass from the whimsical field. A few shimmering, transparent bubbles float gently above it towards the center. The design is minimal and artistic, focusing on the left and center, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty and undecorated. The overall style is a flat 2D full-bleed watercolor with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture, maintaining visual harmony with the rest of the card.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor painting for a birthday card. In the center, a cartoon version of a man (Jordan) is playfully presenting himself, wrapped in a giant red ribbon and bow, to a delighted and laughing cartoon woman (Lao Lao). They are both styled with friendly, simplified features and expressive, happy faces. They stand in a whimsical, sunlit field filled with quirky, smiling flowers and gently rolling hills under a soft blue sky with fluffy, cotton-like clouds. Floating around them are shimmering, transparent birthday bubbles. Centered below the characters, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The artwork is a flat 2D full-bleed watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture. Key elements and text are positioned safely away from all edges.",
    "leftInterior": "A playful and innovative watercolor illustration that continues the humorous theme. The scene depicts a whimsical, high-end boutique display shelf, but instead of luxury items, it's filled with comically mundane objects given a fancy treatment. A single, perfect-looking sock is presented on a velvet cushion under a glass cloche. A shiny golden apple sits on an ornate pedestal. A beautifully framed portrait of a piece of toast with a smiley face made of butter hangs on the wall. The color palette is soft and harmonious with the rest of the card, using pastel pinks, golds, and soft blues. The style is a flat 2D full-bleed watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture. No people are present.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and artistic watercolor design framing the handwritten message. The text is elegantly written in a flowing, legible, and personal cursive script in the center of the page. The message is framed by a delicate, whimsical watercolor illustration of an ornate, empty picture frame, from which the giant red ribbon seen on the front cover playfully spills out and curls around the text block. A few shimmering, transparent bubbles float around the composition, tying it to the front cover's theme. The design feels sophisticated yet lighthearted, providing a beautiful backdrop for the personal message. The style is a flat 2D full-bleed watercolor with soft, flowing colors and visible paper texture. Text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a super expensive gift, but then I remembered having me as your boyfriend is the greatest gift of all. You're welcome! I hope you have a day that's as amazing as you are. Love, Jordan\"."
