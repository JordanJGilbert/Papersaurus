    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a colorful, textured digital art style, reminiscent of painted illustrations. The color palette is vibrant, featuring a deep teal and emerald green background with purple and pink hues blending towards the bottom. The primary subjects are a smiling woman and a toddler being held by her. The woman has dark hair, is wearing a red sweater with a festive, snowflake-like pattern, and a colorful party hat. The toddler has brown hair with a green bow and is wearing a cream-colored sweater with the word \"joyful\" written in script, and red pants. The overall mood is joyful and energetic, with confetti and pixelated shapes (a red heart, a yellow star, and a yellow cross) scattered across the background. The text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a playful, flowing white script font in the upper right quadrant of the card. The composition is dynamic, with the figures positioned off-center to the left, drawing attention to the celebratory text.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a loose, watercolor art style reminiscent of children's book illustrations. The background is a gradient of deep, textured indigo blue fading to a lighter, almost white at the bottom, evoking a nighttime sky. Scattered across the upper half of the background are four stylized, pixelated golden crosses that resemble stars. In the lower left, a bright orange, conical party hat is depicted with thick black outlines and radiating lines indicating texture and shadow, with a blue tip. It casts a subtle, sketchy shadow. To the right of the party hat, a vibrant red, pixelated heart with a bright white highlight is positioned. The overall composition is clean and minimalist, with ample negative space in the upper portion of the card, suggesting a place for optional text or a QR code. The art style is playful and complements a \"funn\" theme by combining simple, iconic imagery with a charming, textured artistic execution.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor illustration of a mixing board panel. The panel is a light, creamy yellow with a teal blue edge and silver screw accents. It features three large, teal blue knobs across the top. Beneath the knobs are three vertical sliders, each with a teal blue slider knob. The sliders are labeled from left to right: \"LOUD LAUGHS BASS\", \"DAD JOKE LEVEL\", and \"AWKWARD DANCE MOVES AGING SPEED\". The first slider is set to a low position, the second to a mid-level, and the third to a slightly higher position. To the right of the third slider, a playful \"POOF!\" is depicted in a speech bubble, with stylized blue water splashes and a label \"FAST\" pointing to the slider. Faintly drawn purple and green musical notes are scattered across the background, creating a cheerful and vibrant atmosphere. The overall artistic style is whimsical and illustrative, with soft watercolor textures and playful lettering.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a dark blue textured background, featuring a decorative Celtic knot border in a dark gray, braided pattern. The border is accented with small, pixelated golden stars at the top corners and left side, and small, pixelated pink hearts at the right side and lower left corner. The printed text \"Jordan, Happy Birthday!\" is in a vibrant, glowing turquoise script, positioned at the top of the message area. Below this, the bulk of the space is dedicated to handwritten messages, with the printed text \"I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered my own birth year and decided to be nice. Hope your day is as much fun as you are (minus the questionable dance moves).\" also in the glowing turquoise script. The bottom of the message area includes the printed text \"All the best,\" and \"Gilbert\" in the same glowing turquoise script. The overall style is whimsical with a touch of retro gaming aesthetic due to the pixelated elements."
