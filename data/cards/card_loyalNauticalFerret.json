    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 ratio, in a watercolor painting style. The top half depicts an underwater scene with vibrant turquoise blue water, with soft, diffused light filtering from the surface, creating a magical, dreamlike atmosphere. A stylized, illustrated young girl with dark hair, wearing a blue wetsuit and a diving mask, is looking upwards in wonder. She is surrounded by several small, brightly colored fish (orange and yellow) and a gentle green sea turtle swims gracefully in the upper right corner. The words \"thank you\" are written in elegant, flowing white cursive script across the center of the underwater scene, positioned safely away from the edges. The bottom half of the card transitions to a lush green landscape, with soft, impressionistic brushstrokes of green and hints of purple flowers. A joyful, stylized illustration of a young woman with long, dark wavy hair adorned with a delicate pink rose flower crown and a yellow lei around her neck is smiling warmly. Her expression is sincere and emotional. The overall color palette is rich and inviting, with a clear division between the cool blues of the ocean and the warm greens of the land. The art style is consistent with delicate watercolor textures, visible brushstrokes, and organic paint bleeds, creating a heartfelt and memorable visual.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 ratio, in a watercolor painting style.

A serene and minimalist design that echoes the theme. The top section features soft, blended blues and hints of deep indigo, suggesting the ocean depths or a twilight sky, with subtle, organic paint bleeds. A single, simplified green sea turtle silhouette or a gentle wave crest is subtly depicted on the left side, flowing towards the center.

The overall composition is peaceful and uncluttered, with decorative elements focused towards the center-left and avoiding the bottom-right corner, which remains clear for a QR code.

Around the message, delicate, stylized watercolor elements like bubbles, gentle seaweed tendrils, or abstract representations of stars aligning are incorporated, complementing the script without overpowering it. The bottom portion features a soft, out-of-focus green and yellow watercolor wash, evoking the lushness of Hawaii or a sense of peaceful fulfillment.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a deep, velvety navy blue watercolor background that transitions subtly to a slightly lighter blue towards the bottom. The background is densely speckled with small, bright white dots, representing stars, with a few larger, more luminous stars scattered throughout, some appearing as soft glows. In the lower left quadrant, a wispy, pale blue-white streak of watercolor suggests a faint, ethereal trail, like a shooting star or a cosmic current. This streak extends upwards and curves gently towards the center-left, creating a sense of movement and celestial magic. The overall impression is serene, vast, and peaceful, with a focus on subtle cosmic beauty. The lower-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square, is deliberately left clear and undecorated to allow space for a QR code, with decorative elements primarily concentrated on the left and center areas of the cover. The watercolor style is evident in the soft blending of colors, visible paper texture, and delicate paint application.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover design for a greeting card with a deep, velvety navy blue watercolor background, densely speckled with small, bright white dots representing stars.

The background is a blend of dark blues, teals, and hints of magenta and purple, with subtle paint bleeds and paper texture. Three iconic landmarks are depicted within this celestial expanse, connected by thin, luminous white lines that form a triangle: the Golden Gate Bridge at the top, glowing with ethereal light; a silhouette of a New York skyscraper (resembling the Empire State Building) on the left; and a stylized, delicate white hibiscus flower on the right. The overall composition evokes a sense of dreams, aspirations, and the alignment of opportunities, with a magical and heartfelt tone.

    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a serene watercolor background of gentle ocean waves in varying shades of turquoise and a soft pink and pale blue sky at the top. The central focus is a beautifully detailed illustration of a large, light beige seashell positioned on the water's edge, facing forward. Emanating from the top of the seashell are elegant, flowing lines of white musical notes and staves, curving upwards and outwards in a stylized, almost ethereal manner, suggesting a melody being sung. The handwritten message \"Sing your true song Mele\" is integrated seamlessly within this musical motif, with each word rendered in a delicate, dark gray cursive script that is both legible and artistic, appearing as if handwritten with a fine nib pen. The script has natural variations in line weight and a graceful flow, enhancing the heartfelt and personal tone. The overall design uses soft, blended watercolor textures, with subtle paper grain visible, creating a peaceful and evocative atmosphere. The space around the central illustration and text is intentionally kept open, providing ample room for additional handwritten notes. The color palette is soft and harmonious, dominated by blues, greens, and subtle warm tones from the shell and sky."
