    "frontCover": "A whimsical full-body watercolor illustration of the couple from the reference photo, reimagined in a humorous and charming birthday scene. Lao Lao, on the left, is wearing a party hat slightly askew and joyfully rides piggyback on Jordan. Jordan, on the right, has an exaggerated, playful expression of exertion as he gives her the piggyback ride. Both are laughing. They are surrounded by a flurry of floating, colorful birthday treats like macarons, cupcakes with oversized sprinkles, and boba tea drinks, all painted with soft, blended watercolor washes. The background is a simple, light pastel wash to keep the focus on the couple. In the center, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script. The entire image has a flat 2D greeting card aesthetic, characterized by soft edges, flowing colors, and a lighthearted, celebratory feel.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference. Create a high-quality final version that:\n- Maintains the exact same composition, character positions, and overall design\n- Enhances details, textures, and color vibrancy\n- Corrects any minor imperfections or artifacts\n- Adds professional polish while staying true to the draft\n- Think of this as the \"final art\" version of the provided sketch\n\nORIGINAL CONTEXT TO MAINTAIN:\n- To: Lao Lao\n- From: Jordan\n- Relationship: Lao Lao is Jordan's girlfriend\n\n- Reference photos of: Lao Lao on the left, Jordan on the right",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. The entire background is a solid, very light pastel wash, consistent with the front cover's style. In the top-left quadrant, there is a small, simple, and elegant arrangement of two or three colorful macarons, painted in a delicate watercolor style with soft, flowing colors. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left completely blank and clear of any design elements. The overall aesthetic is clean, with about 20% visual decoration, maintaining a professional, flat 2D look for printing."
