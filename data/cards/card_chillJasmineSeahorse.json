    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a birthday greeting card, featuring a humorous and chaotic scene with three stylized cartoon characters in medieval-inspired attire, reminiscent of classic animated films. The overall art style is flat 2D with bold outlines and a vibrant, limited color palette of blues, yellows, and flesh tones. A large banner at the top reads \\\"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CRAIG!\\\" in bold, slightly distressed orange lettering, attached by blue ribbon. The character on the left, with brown hair and a stern expression, is struggling to inflate a yellow balloon animal. The character in the center, with blonde hair and a regal blue cape, looks bewildered while holding a tangled blue ribbon. The character in the foreground, with brown hair and a concerned expression, is carrying a tall, tiered birthday cake with lit candles. Scattered yellow balloons and blue confetti add to the festive, albeit slightly disorganized, atmosphere. The background is a solid royal blue. The composition is dynamic and full of character.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, a simple and cohesive closing to the story. The art style remains flat 2D with bold outlines and the same color palette. It features a stylized, whimsical arrangement of blue ribbons and a few scattered yellow confetti shapes, subtly referencing elements from the front cover. The design is clean and minimalist, providing a peaceful and artistic conclusion without any text or characters. The composition is balanced and visually appealing, echoing the overall theme and tone of the card.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a birthday greeting card, continuing the humorous and slightly chaotic theme with the same flat 2D art style, bold outlines, and color palette. This panel depicts a birthday party setting from a unique perspective. In the foreground, a character resembling a 'friendly beast' character from a fairy tale is comically attempting to balance a teetering stack of gifts on his head, with a look of intense concentration. Behind him, other stylized cartoon figures, possibly representing various fairy tale characters in a modern, casual interpretation, are engaged in fun, slightly askew party activities â€“ one might be juggling oversized, cartoonish cutlery, another attempting to tie a giant, impractical bow. The background elements include hints of a medieval-meets-party decor with banners and streamers, all rendered in the established color palette of blues, yellows, and warm earth tones. The mood is lighthearted and energetic, suggesting a fun, if slightly clumsy, celebration.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a birthday greeting card, serving as the climax of the visual story and featuring the message beautifully integrated into the artwork. The art style is consistent with the other panels â€“ flat 2D, bold outlines, and the characteristic color palette. The message, \\\"Forget glass slippers and enchanted castles, this year we're rolling out the royal treatment just for you! Hope your birthday is filled with less drama than a fairy tale kingdom and more cake than a royal banquet. Happy Birthday to our favorite real-life prince!\\\" is displayed prominently in a playful, slightly distressed orange font, arranged in a way that feels like part of the celebratory scene, perhaps on a scroll or banner that appears to be held by unseen hands. The surrounding artwork depicts an exaggerated, whimsical royal feast â€“ a table laden with impossibly large cakes, overflowing platters of cartoonishly depicted food, and perhaps a confused-looking dragon serving as a waiter. The overall impression is one of grand, slightly absurd, and joyful celebration, perfectly framing the humorous birthday message.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a simple, minimalist illustration. The background is a solid, vibrant royal blue. Centered on the background is a stylized yellow balloon twisted into the shape of a sword. This balloon sword is rendered with thick black outlines and subtle highlights to give it a glossy, inflated appearance. Scattered around the balloon sword are a few small, abstract red shapes and a short, curled piece of white string, suggesting remnants of party decorations. The overall aesthetic is clean, graphic, and playfully whimsical, offering a quiet, understated resolution to a festive theme without any text or characters.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a flat, 2D, full-bleed background in a vibrant orange. The artwork features a playful and slightly chaotic birthday party scene with a distinct graphic novel illustration style. The composition is dynamic, with elements scattered across the surface, creating a sense of energetic celebration. Key visual elements include:\n\n*   **A slice of cake:** Prominently placed in the lower right quadrant, it is a generous slice with white frosting and visible layers of orange cake, topped with a single, lit orange candle with a yellow flame. The cake sits on a bright yellow plate with a dark outline.\n*   **Balloons:** Several balloons are depicted in various states of inflation and color: a large teal balloon on the left, a yellow balloon in the upper center, and a small purple balloon in the upper right. One orange balloon on the left appears deflated, with a twisted opening.\n*   **Party hats:** Two distinct party hats are present: a teal hat with black polka dots and an orange arrow with a brown fletching piercing through it, positioned in the mid-left. Another conical party hat, striped with orange and yellow, stands in the upper right.\n*   **Confetti and streamers:** Small, scattered confetti shapes in blue, pink, and yellow are strewn across the orange background. A single purple and pink streamer is visible in the lower left.\n*   **Bowls:** Two small, dark blue bowls are positioned in the upper left, and a lighter beige bowl with dark speckles is in the upper center.\n*   **Shadows:** Subtle, dark, stylized shadows are cast by the balloons, party hats, and bowls, giving a sense of depth and grounding the elements to the background.\n*   **Color Palette:** The dominant color is a rich, warm orange, complemented by teal, yellow, orange, purple, blue, pink, and beige. The colors are bold and saturated, contributing to the cheerful and humorous tone.\n*   **Artistic Style:** The style is characterized by clean, bold linework with a slight texture to the background, giving it a retro, graphic feel. The shapes are simplified and slightly geometric, fitting a modern, stylized illustration aesthetic. The overall impression is one of festive, slightly whimsical, and bold design, ideal for a humorous birthday card.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a bold, royal blue background. The central area is dedicated to the humorous birthday message, rendered in a clean, slightly stylized sans-serif typeface with a warm, off-white color. The text is strategically placed to allow ample room for handwritten notes, with a clear margin from the top and bottom edges. Framing the message on the left and right are whimsical, yellow balloon animals resembling swords and a jester's hat within shields, all created with a flat, graphic illustration style. Delicate, curling white ribbon and confetti elements are scattered throughout, adding a celebratory and playful feel. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of mid-century illustration with a touch of playful sophistication, maintaining a consistent color palette of royal blue, yellow, and white with a soft, glowy lighting."
