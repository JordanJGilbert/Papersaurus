In the center, a cartoon character illustration of Jordan, based on the reference photo, is dramatically passed out face-down on a giant, fluffy slice of birthday cake, with arms and legs sprawled out in a comical food coma. Little puffs of snoozing \"Zzz\" float up from his head. Sprinkles and frosting are stuck to his cheek and hair. Next to him, a cartoon character of John, based on the reference photo, is gleefully holding a single lit candle on a tiny cupcake, looking at the viewer with a mischievous grin as if to say, \"I got him his own cake.\" In the center, elegant, readable, handwritten cursive script says \"Happy Birthday\". The style is lighthearted and humorous, with soft flowing watercolor colors, visible artistic brush strokes, subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges.
