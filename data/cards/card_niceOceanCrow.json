The illustration will exaggerate the graduate's key features from the reference photo in a playful and affectionate wayâ€”perhaps with a slightly oversized graduation cap perched jauntily on their head and an expression of comical relief and triumph. The linework will be loose and expressive, filled with personality, and the soft, layered colors will add warmth and a gentle, handmade feel.

He is wearing a white dress shirt, a blue tie, a blue and yellow graduation stole, and black pants. He has a very wide, happy smile. Behind him is a classic building with columns, hinting at a university or school. Green trees and a bright blue sky with a few subtle stars or specks of light form the background.

The text is set in a friendly, slightly quirky, hand-drawn style with dark brown ink, resembling colored pencil lettering.\n\nThe message is visually integrated into a charming, whimsical diagram that illustrates a humorous \"Real World Algorithm.\" Flanking the text on the left are hand-drawn icons: a diploma scroll connected by an orange arrow to a piggy bank with the text \"GET DIPLOMA\" below it, and further down, a contented, smiling yellow circle emoji connected by a blue arrow to a banner that reads \"WEEKEND NAPS\" above another banner labeled \"NAPS\". On the right side of the text, an orange arrow leads from the diploma to a box labeled \"PRICEY SNACKS\" overflowing with colorful candy. Below this, a teal arrow points to a small, grumpy blue monster with horns, labeled \"BILLS\". Another blue arrow originates from the \"BILLS\" monster and leads to a crumpled piece of paper labeled \"WEEKEND NAPS\".\n\nThe entire illustration is rendered in a flat 2D art style, reminiscent of hand-drawn colored pencil and light watercolor washes. The color palette is warm and muted, featuring soft yellows, muted oranges, greens, blues, and browns, creating a cohesive and inviting feel. The background is a simple, creamy off-white.
