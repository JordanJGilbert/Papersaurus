    "frontCover": "A watercolor painting of a funny birthday card, flat 2D illustration. In the center, a cartoon character of Jordan, based on the reference photo, is dramatically tripping over a tiny pebble on a path, mid-fall with a comically surprised expression, arms flailing. Floating around him are various birthday items like a party hat, a slice of cake, and a single balloon, all seemingly flying away from him as he falls. The background is a simple, soft-focus park scene with gentle green and blue watercolor washes and visible paper texture. In the center of the card, written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan... try not to fall into another year!\" The entire image has the distinct style of a watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.",
