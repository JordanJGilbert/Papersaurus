NO CAP.\n\nYou're so real for that,\nNeelu\"\n\nReference: \"artistic transformation\"\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the internet memes, chaotic energy, and unhinged vibes tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts.

Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"graduation\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a vibrant and contemporary illustrated portrait style, featuring a custom character transformation of Zoyah from a 'goblin mode' student (perhaps in pajamas, with messy hair, surrounded by books and coffee) on one side, to a radiant graduate in her cap and gown on the other. The art will be rendered with a warm, celebratory color paletteâ€”think golden yellows, celebratory confetti pinks, and proud bluesâ€”using digital gouache brushes that mimic the rich, painterly texture of traditional art. The background will feature soft, hand-drawn celebratory elements like sparkling stars, floating confetti, and a subtle laurel wreath, all drawn with a charming, slightly imperfect line quality to emphasize the personal, heartfelt nature of the card and Neelu's proud, joyful message.\n\n2.

    "frontCover": "Here is a detailed prompt for the front cover of the greeting card, designed to generate an image that closely matches the provided example, with a focus on artistic style, character representation, color palette, and thematic elements:\n\n\"Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring a split composition. The left side depicts a stylized, exaggerated cartoon character in a 'goblin mode' state, hunched over a laptop. This character has dark circles under their eyes, a distressed expression, wearing headphones, and surrounded by stacks of books and papers with digital-themed elements like 'ERROR' messages, a red warning triangle, and a 'LOADING...' bar with a progress indicator. The color palette on this side is predominantly dark blues and purples, with sharp, angular lines creating a chaotic and stressed atmosphere. The right side of the card showcases a jubilant, stylized cartoon graduate character, smiling brightly, wearing a dark blue cap and gown, and holding a diploma. This character is set against a vibrant, celebratory background of pink and orange hues, with scattered confetti and stylized yellow starbursts, suggesting a city skyline. The overall artistic style is a flat, bold, graphic illustration with clean lines and a limited but impactful color palette. The text \"Happy Graduation dearest! You did it!\" is prominently displayed across the center of the card in a bold, white, handwritten-style font with a subtle blue outline, bridging the two contrasting scenes. The art style is reminiscent of modern digital illustration with a slight retro or comic-book feel, emphasizing expressive character design and dynamic color blocking. The mood is a chaotic but ultimately triumphant celebration of graduation, capturing the essence of both the struggle and the achievement. The composition is balanced yet dynamic, with a clear visual narrative of transformation from stress to success.\"",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a graduation greeting card, in a flat 2D illustrated style with a minimalist and endearing aesthetic. The background is a solid, soft rose pink color. Centered in the lower half of the frame, a stylized, open laptop is depicted in a pale lavender color, with a thick purple outline. A simple, bright yellow star with a similar purple outline is placed on the lid of the laptop, to the left of a small, curved line that suggests a gentle smile or a subtle expression. The overall composition is clean and uncluttered, focusing on a single, charming graphic element. There is ample empty space above the laptop, particularly in the upper 10% of the image, and a clear area in the bottom right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left undecorated for a QR code. The artistic style and color palette subtly echo the \"artistic transformation\" theme by presenting a simplified, iconic representation that could serve as a sweet, quiet conclusion to a visual narrative. There is no text on the back cover.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, depicting a winding, isometric path representing a challenging academic journey. The path is a vibrant, glossy orange with a subtle red edge, weaving through a deep purple background. Scattered around the path are stylized, teal-colored abstract shapes with white speckles, evoking puddles or moments of reflection. Along the path, there are several digital screens, each displaying a simplified, adorable orange cat face with blue outlines. A prominent stack of books labeled \"BARRIER\" in bold blue lettering stands to the right, signifying an academic obstacle. To the left, a sign reads \"CAFFEINATED TEARS\" in white text on a dark blue rectangular sign. At the top, a progress bar with \"LOADING...\" and \"99%\" indicates the nearing completion of a task. The overall style is flat, 2D, illustrative with bold outlines and a slightly retro, playful aesthetic. The composition emphasizes a sense of progress and the overcoming of difficulties, with a touch of internet meme culture conveyed through the cat icons and the \"loading\" motif. The artistic style is clean and graphic, utilizing a limited but effective color palette of purple, orange, teal, blue, and white.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a vibrant, hyper-saturated pink background. The central area is dominated by a purple-blue neon-style border with a pixelated effect, creating a distinct frame for the text. Inside this frame, the message is presented in a handwritten cursive font that has a slight glowing effect, mimicking a marker or pen with a luminous quality. The text itself is a bright white with subtle purple shading, enhancing its readability against the darker interior of the frame. The typography is flowing and personal, with some letters slightly larger or more stylized to add character. Surrounding the main text within the neon border are pixelated golden starbursts and plus symbols, interspersed with small, pixelated golden trophy icons, particularly concentrated towards the bottom left. The top of the card features \"LEVEL COMPLETE\" in large, yellow, pixelated block letters against the pink background, reinforcing the gaming/achievement theme. The overall aesthetic is retro-futuristic with a strong GenZ internet culture influence, using bold colors and pixel art elements. The prompt should capture the specific layout, the neon-pixelated border, the unique handwritten text style with its glow, and the placement of celebratory pixelated icons. The style should be flat 2D illustration with a digital gouache texture for the background elements and sharp, clean lines for the pixel art and neon.\n\nPrompt:\n\"Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space, featuring a vibrant, hyper-saturated pink full-bleed background. Centrally positioned is a stylized, purple-blue neon-style border with a distinct pixelated edge, creating a prominent frame. Inside this border, the message is rendered in a bright white, flowing handwritten cursive font with a subtle glowing effect and a hint of purple shading, making it pop against the inner pink background of the frame. Accompanying the text within the frame are scattered pixelated golden starbursts, plus symbols, and small pixelated golden trophy icons, concentrated mainly in the bottom left quadrant. The overall style is a flat 2D illustration with bold, contrasting colors and pixel art elements, evoking a retro-gaming aesthetic with a modern, chaotic GenZ vibe.\""
