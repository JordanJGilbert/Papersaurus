    "backCover": "A simple, artistic, and peaceful watercolor design. In the center, a single beautifully decorated cupcake sits on a delicate plate, identical to the ones on the front cover, but this time with two intertwined candles, one pink and one blue, their flames gently extinguished with a faint wisp of smoke rising. A few scattered pastel confetti pieces from the front cover rest on the surface around the plate. The background is a clean, soft white with gentle, abstract watercolor washes of cream and light blue bleeding from the edges towards the center, creating a serene and elegant feel. The design is minimal, focusing on the left and center, leaving the bottom-right corner clear. The style maintains the soft watercolor aesthetic with visible paper texture.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and endearing watercolor scene. A charming, cartoon-style grandmother with short, stylish white hair and a warm smile sits in a comfy armchair, about to blow out a single candle on a small, beautifully decorated birthday cupcake she holds. Suddenly, a cute cartoon baby girl with a wisp of dark hair, wearing a party hat, playfully pops out from behind the armchair with a mischievous grin, holding a matching cupcake with one candle, as if to say \"Me too!\". The background is a soft, warm living room setting with gentle watercolor washes of cream and light blue. Confetti in pastel shades of pink, yellow, and mint green seems to be floating down. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday to you... and you!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is a whimsical watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "A playful and abstract watercolor illustration representing a calendar page for the shared birthday month. The page is rendered in a loose, artistic style with soft washes of color. Instead of a grid of numbers, there's a whimsical, spiraling path of dates leading to one single, oversized, beautifully calligraphed number, which is circled by a heart made of delicate watercolor brushstrokes. Two sets of tiny, cartoonish footprints, one larger (grandmother's) and one smaller (baby's), are playfully painted along the path, meeting at the circled date. The background is a blend of the card's pastel color palette, with soft bleeds and splatters creating a joyful, celebratory atmosphere. The style is pure watercolor with visible paper texture and artistic imperfections.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and artistic watercolor design elegantly framing the message. A delicate, hand-painted watercolor banner, looking like a flowing ribbon in shades of soft pink and mint green, unfurls gracefully across the top third of the page. Dangling from the banner on fine, painted strings are two charming, simple lockets\u2014one heart-shaped and one star-shaped\u2014symbolizing the two birthday stars. The background is a soft cream with subtle, abstract watercolor washes that bleed in from the corners. Centered perfectly below the banner is the message, written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are!\\n\\nLove,\\nJohn, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\". The entire piece is rendered in a soft watercolor style with artistic brush strokes and visible paper texture."
