    "frontCover": "A watercolor painting of two cartoon characters, Jeff and Jordan, in a humorous and light-hearteed scene, flat 2D artwork. Jeff, based on the reference photo, is depicted playfully attempting to balance a giant, wobbly stack of brightly colored gift boxes, his eyes wide with comical concentration. Jordan, also based on the reference photo, is laughing heartily, pointing at Jeff's teetering tower of presents. The background is a soft, minimalist wash of pastel colors with subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday Jordan!\". The entire illustration has the soft, flowing colors and artistic brushstrokes characteristic of a watercolor painting.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene watercolor painting that complements the front cover. The design features a single, brightly colored gift box, similar to those on the front, sitting peacefully in the upper-left area. The background is a full-bleed, soft wash of pastel colors with a subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds, matching the front cover's aesthetic. The overall composition is simple and clean. CRITICAL: The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, must remain completely blank and free of any artwork or texture for QR code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, full-bleed decorative watercolor painting. The artwork consists of an abstract pattern of colorful confetti and delicate streamers cascading gently from the top corners, rendered with soft, flowing colors and artistic brushstrokes. The background is a continuation of the soft pastel wash with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds, creating a cohesive and celebratory feel that harmonizes with the rest of the card. The design is purely decorative, containing no characters or text.",
    "rightInterior": "A decorative watercolor illustration featuring the message text beautifully integrated into the art. The background is a full-bleed, soft pastel wash with paper texture and organic paint bleeds, consistent with the card's overall style. A few colorful, beautifully wrapped gift boxes are artistically placed along the bottom edge, grounding the design. The following text is written in the center in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script: \"Jordan,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but I decided to be the bigger person since I\u2019m still a little bit younger than you are. Have an amazing day, you antique!\n\nAll the best,\nJeff\". The text and key art elements are positioned to maintain a safe margin of at least 10% from all edges."
