    "frontCover": "{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a birthday greeting card in a clean, minimalist, flat 2D illustration style. The background is a soft, creamy off-white. A simple line drawing of a rocket is depicted in the upper right quadrant, angled upwards and to the left. The rocket has a pointed nose cone, a circular window, and two swept-back fins. Trailing from the rocket is a thin, curved line representing exhaust, dotted with small, scattered shapes in coral orange and teal blue. Below the rocket's trajectory, in the lower center of the card, are the words \\\"happy birthday\\\" in a bold, sans-serif, black font. The text is centered horizontally and positioned to avoid the top and bottom 10% bleed area. The overall mood is playful and celebratory, with a touch of whimsy.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, maintaining the clean, minimalist, flat 2D illustration style. The background is the same soft, creamy off-white as the front cover. A single, small, scattered dot in coral orange is positioned in the lower right corner, serving as a subtle, subtle continuation of the confetti motif from the front. No text or other elements are present, providing a peaceful and uncluttered conclusion to the card's visual narrative.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior spread of a birthday greeting card in a clean, minimalist, flat 2D illustration style. The background is the same soft, creamy off-white. The composition features a stylized, abstract representation of a celestial pathway. A thin, wavy line, starting from the bottom left and arcing upwards towards the center, is rendered in black. Along this line are scattered, irregular dots and small dashes in coral orange and teal blue, mimicking the trail of the rocket from the front cover, but more spread out and delicate. This creates a sense of gentle movement and continuation of the journey theme, without featuring any characters or explicit imagery. The overall mood is serene and slightly whimsical, harmonizing with the front cover's playful tone.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior spread of a birthday greeting card, continuing the clean, minimalist, flat 2D illustration style. The background is the same soft, creamy off-white. The central focus is the message text, carefully integrated into a decorative composition. The text reads: \\\"Jordan,\\n\\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered my own age and decided not to go there. Hope you have a fantastic day!\\n\\n- Craig\\\" This text is presented in a clear, black, sans-serif font, with \\\"Happy birthday\\\" slightly larger and bolder than the rest. The text block is positioned in the center, respecting the safe printing margins. To the upper right and lower left of the text block, subtle decorative elements mirroring the rocket's trail are present: thin, curved lines with scattered dots and dashes in coral orange and teal blue, suggesting a gentle burst of celebration. These elements are less dense than on the front, providing a soft framing for the message. The overall mood is warm, humorous, and personal, perfectly complementing the written sentiment.\"\n}",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a simple happy birthday card with a smart style and funny tone, in a 9:16 ratio. The artwork features a minimalist, clean aesthetic with a very subtle textured off-white background. In the upper right quadrant of the image, there is a small, simple black line drawing of a starburst or asterisk. This element is understated and serves as a subtle, elegant graphic accent that provides a sense of quiet closure to the overall visual story of the card. There is no text on the back cover, and no space reserved for a QR code, allowing the focus to remain on the minimalist design. The overall impression is one of sophisticated simplicity and a gentle, memorable conclusion.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card with a playful and abstract design. The background is a soft, creamy off-white. Dominating the composition are thick, flowing black lines that create a sense of movement and organic curves, reminiscent of calligraphy or spilled ink. These lines loop and swirl across the page in a dynamic, yet uncluttered pattern, without forming any discernible shapes or characters. Scattered amongst these bold lines are small, oval-shaped confetti elements in two contrasting colors: a soft, muted teal and a warm, pale coral. These tiny pops of color are strategically placed to break up the large black curves and add a subtle festive touch. The overall aesthetic is minimalist, modern, and whimsical, utilizing a limited color palette of black, cream, teal, and coral to create a harmonious and visually engaging design. The style is flat 2D artwork, with a clean, graphic feel.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a clean, minimalist aesthetic. The background is a soft, creamy off-white. A thick, flowing, black organic line begins at the top edge, curves down the right side of the page, and ends with a gentle upward curve near the bottom. This line acts as a subtle, artistic frame for the message. Scattered around this line are small, irregular confetti shapes in muted pastel colors: a small pale yellow square, a small pale blue square, and a small pale orange square. The text, including \"Jordan, Happy birthday!\" and the body of the message, is in a clean, sans-serif black font, positioned centrally on the page, with ample negative space around it to allow for handwritten notes. The overall design is simple, modern, and elegant, with the organic line and pastel confetti providing subtle, playful decorative elements without overwhelming the message. The style is flat 2D artwork, suitable for printing."
