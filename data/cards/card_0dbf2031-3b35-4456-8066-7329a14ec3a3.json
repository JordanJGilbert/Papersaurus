    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that brings peaceful closure. On the left and center of the card, a single, beautifully detailed paintbrush rests, its bristles still damp with a rainbow of pastel colors, mirroring the palette from the front cover. A few whimsical, colorful paint splatters float gently around the brush, creating a sense of artistic finality. The overall composition is minimal, serene, and asymmetrical, with the bottom-right corner area left completely empty and undecorated. The background is a soft, pale cream watercolor wash with visible paper texture, providing a quiet and artistic ending to the card's story.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor scene depicting an 'artistic transformation' machine. On the left, two cartoon twin girls, inspired by Audrey and Vivi, with friendly, simplified features, are shown as simple stick figures on a canvas entering a whimsical, colorful contraption made of gears, paint tubes, and funny-looking scientific gizmos. On the right, emerging from the machine's other side, the same two girls are transformed into beautifully detailed watercolor portraits, laughing joyfully. The machine has a playful, Rube Goldberg-like quality. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday to two works of art!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The background is a soft, full-bleed watercolor wash of cheerful pastel colors with artistic paint splatters. Key elements are kept away from the edges for safe printing. The style features soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent the people in these reference photos with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:\n- REPRESENT ALL PEOPLE: If multiple reference photos are provided, create cartoon versions of ALL people shown, bringing them together in the same scene\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles worn by each person in their reference photo\n- COMPLETE accessories: include ALL accessories visible on each person (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.)\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nStudy every detail of the people in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features.

    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed abstract watercolor masterpiece that captures the essence of a 'cake explosion'. This is a dynamic and joyful celebration of color and texture, with swirls of frosting-like whites, pinks, and lavenders blending with cake-like golden yellows and chocolatey browns. Whimsical sprinkles are represented by vibrant, multi-colored dots and dashes scattered playfully across the page. The composition is energetic yet harmonious, with soft edges, beautiful color bleeds, and visible paper texture, creating a purely visual and celebratory experience that embodies the 'double the fun' and 'shenanigans' mentioned in the message. The artwork is abstract and contains no text or figures, serving as a creative and unexpected visual feast.",
    "rightInterior": "An elegant and innovative decorative watercolor design framing the birthday message. Two beautifully rendered watercolor cakes, one on the top left and one on the bottom right, flank the central text area. These cakes are not simple; they are whimsical creations, each appearing to be a miniature, edible version of the 'artistic transformation' machine from the front cover, complete with tiny candy gears and licorice conveyor belts. Colorful, edible-looking paint splatters and delicate swirls of frosting artfully connect the two cakes, creating a beautiful and unique border. At the center, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and personal handwritten cursive script: 'Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey! It's pretty clear that greatness decided to strike twice on the same day, and we're so glad we get to celebrate both of you. May your day be filled with double the cake, double the fun, and only half the shenanigans... maybe.' The background is a soft, clean watercolor wash, ensuring the text is perfectly legible. The entire design is artistic, humorous, and cohesive with the rest of the card."
