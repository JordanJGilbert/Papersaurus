    "frontCover": "Humorous birthday greeting card front cover, flat 2D watercolor painting of a chaotic and funny kitchen scene. In the center, illustrated versions of Jordan (person on the right in photo) and Lao Lao (person on the left in photo) are having a disastrous but joyful baking session. Jordan, wearing his black gown from the photo but with a comically oversized, flour-dusted chef's hat perched crookedly on his head, is laughing hysterically as he juggles a stack of precariously balanced birthday pancakes that are threatening to topple over. Pancake batter is splattered on his gown. Lao Lao, wearing her white dress, stands beside him with a mischievous grin, holding a can of whipped cream and spraying a giant cloud of it into the air, with some landing on Jordan's face. The kitchen is a delightful mess: flour dusts the air, eggs are cracked on the counter with gooey yolks running down, a bowl of colorful sprinkles has been knocked over, scattering everywhere, and a friendly, cartoonish golden retriever is in the foreground, trying to lick a fallen pancake off the floor. The background is a soft wash of cheerful kitchen colors like sunny yellow and mint green. Centered on the card in a clear space is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" in a beautiful, readable, dark brown handwritten cursive script. The overall style is lighthearted and artistic, with soft edges, vibrant color bleeds, and a charming, hand-painted feel.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "Minimalist back cover for a greeting card. Flat 2D watercolor painting style with a very simple design. The background is a full-bleed, soft wash of pale mint green with visible paper texture and subtle, organic paint bleeds. In the top-center, there is a small, single, beautifully painted golden retriever paw print rendered in a warm, dark brown watercolor, as if lightly stamped onto the paper. The rest of the card is clean and empty, especially the bottom-right quadrant which is clear for a QR code. The overall aesthetic is artistic, clean, and cohesive with a cheerful, hand-painted theme, maintaining the style from the front cover."
