    "frontCover": "Flat 2D comic book style greeting card front. A dynamic and hilarious action scene where Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are transformed into comic book superheroes. Lao Lao, in her light blue sweatshirt, is \"Super Lao Lao,\" striking a heroic, confident pose front and center. She has a wide, joyful smile and one hand on her hip, while the other hand holds up a giant, steaming, magical coffee mug that radiates energy lines. Jordan, in his brown hoodie, is her trusty sidekick, standing slightly behind her with a comically amazed expression, pointing towards her as if presenting her greatness. They are surrounded by a team of adorable, small \"super-dogs\" of various cute breeds, each wearing a tiny hero cape and mask, leaping and flying through the air around the couple in action poses. The background is a vibrant city skyline bursting with color, featuring classic comic book \"POW!\" and \"ZAP!\" sound effect bubbles. In the center of the card, floating in a dynamic, fun-to-read comic book font, is the text \"Happy Birthday to My Super Lao Lao!\". The overall illustration uses bold outlines, a vibrant color palette with lots of primary colors, and halftone dot patterns for shading, creating an authentic, retro comic book feel.",
    "backCover": "Minimalist comic book art style design for a greeting card back cover. A clean, light-colored background, possibly a soft yellow or light blue, with a subtle halftone dot pattern. In the top-left corner, a small, stylized comic book sound effect bubble, like a classic \"ZAP!\" or a starburst, rendered with bold outlines and vibrant primary colors (red, blue, yellow) that match the front cover's aesthetic. The rest of the card is empty space, with the bottom-right corner completely clear. Flat 2D vector. 20% visual density.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative background for the left interior of a greeting card, in a vibrant comic book art style. A full-bleed background featuring a dynamic, abstract cityscape silhouette at the bottom, rendered with bold black outlines against a colorful sky filled with radiating energy lines and halftone dot patterns. The sky uses a gradient of bright comic book colors like magenta, cyan, and yellow. Floating playfully across the upper portion of the page are several empty comic book speech bubbles and thought bubbles of various shapes and sizes, inviting personalization. No people or text. Flat 2D vector. 40% visual density.",
    "rightInterior": "A design for the right interior of a greeting card, leaving ample space for a handwritten message. The background is a very light, neutral color with a faint halftone dot pattern. A simple, clean border frames the page, composed of a bold, single-color outline. In the top-left and bottom-right corners are small, tasteful comic book style starbursts or accent graphics, using the vibrant primary color palette from the front cover. The central area is completely open and clean, optimized for readability. Flat 2D vector. 20% visual density.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my dearest Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to get you a pogo stick to celebrate, but then I realized with legs like yours, you could probably just hop to the moon and back on your own. Thanks for always being a step above the rest and for walking into my life.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
