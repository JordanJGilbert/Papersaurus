    "frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor painting of a funny birthday card front. In the center, a cartoon illustration of Jordan, based on the reference photo, is dramatically tripping over a comically small, single birthday candle placed in the middle of the floor. Jordan is mid-tumble with an expression of surprised disbelief, arms flailing, and a party hat flying off his head. Beside the scene, the sender, John, also as a cartoon character from his reference photo, is sheepishly holding a lighter with a tiny wisp of smoke, shrugging with a \"who, me?\" look. The background is a clean, textured watercolor paper with soft, lighthearted color washes and organic paint bleeds. In the center, elegantly written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday\". The overall style is lighthearted and humorous, with artistic brush strokes and a soft, flowing color palette.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A serene and minimalist flat 2D watercolor painting for the back of a birthday card. The background is a clean, textured watercolor paper with soft, lighthearted color washes and organic paint bleeds, matching the front cover. In the upper-left corner, a single, tiny wisp of smoke drifts upwards, beautifully rendered with delicate watercolor strokes, referencing the lighter from the front cover. The design is simple and elegant, creating a peaceful contrast to the humorous front. IMPORTANT: The entire bottom-right corner, in an area of at least 1 inch square, must be left completely blank with only the plain watercolor texture, free of any artistic elements for QR code placement.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful full-bleed decorative art piece for the left interior of a greeting card, in a flat 2D watercolor style consistent with the front cover. The artwork features a playful, abstract pattern of colorful party hat triangles and tiny birthday candle shapes scattered whimsically across a textured watercolor paper background. The shapes are rendered with soft, flowing colors and artistic brush strokes, with visible organic paint bleeds at the edges. The overall mood is festive and lighthearted, complementing the card's theme without using any characters or text.",
    "rightInterior": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration for the right interior of a birthday card, featuring a beautiful and highly legible message. The background is a clean, textured watercolor paper with soft, lighthearted color washes. A delicate and artistic border of confetti and streamer-like watercolor strokes frames the central area, using the same soft, flowing color palette as the front cover. In the center, positioned for maximum readability away from all edges, the following message is written in a beautiful, elegant, and crystal-clear handwritten cursive script: \"Jordan,\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I remembered I've known you forever and that would just make me feel old too. Hope you have a fantastic day filled with cake and questionable decisions!\nBest,\nJohn\". The text must be perfectly legible, with high contrast against the background. The decorative elements must enhance the message without obscuring any part of it. No characters or people are present in the artwork."
