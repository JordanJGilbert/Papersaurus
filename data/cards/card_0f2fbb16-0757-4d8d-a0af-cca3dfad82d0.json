    "backCover": "A simple and artistic watercolor design bringing the story to a peaceful close. In the center, a single, beautifully detailed party hat, identical to the ones worn on the front cover, rests beside a small, elegant watercolor heart. A few delicate pieces of confetti from the front cover are scattered gently around them. The background is a minimal, soft wash of the same warm watercolor palette used throughout the card, fading to white at the edges. The design is focused on the center and left, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. This subtle, serene composition provides a quiet, complementary ending. Painted in a soft watercolor style with visible paper texture.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor scene. In the center, a fun cartoon baby girl with a mischievous grin, wearing a party hat, winks at the viewer while holding a giant, comically oversized calendar planner.

Next to her, a joyful cartoon grandmother with a warm, laughing expression, also wearing a matching party hat, looks at the baby with amusement and affection. They are surrounded by a shower of soft-colored confetti and floating birthday balloons. The background is a soft, warm watercolor wash of yellows and pinks. Centered in a clear space above the characters is the text \"Happy Birthday to you... and you!\" in a beautiful, flowing handwritten cursive script.

    "leftInterior": "A whimsical and funny watercolor illustration depicting two party hats, one large and one small, sitting side-by-side on a whimsical, fluffy cloud. Above them, a speech bubble emerges from the smaller hat, containing a playful drawing of a baby's bottle and a rattle, as if it's dreaming of its birthday presents. From the larger hat's speech bubble, a drawing of a teacup and a good book emerges. A delicate trail of shimmering watercolor stars and tiny hearts connects the two speech bubbles, symbolizing their shared special day. The background is a gentle sky-blue watercolor wash with soft, ethereal clouds. This abstract scene humorously hints at their different birthday wishes while maintaining a cohesive and artistic feel.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design frames the heartfelt message. An elegant, abstract swirl of soft pink, yellow, and blue watercolor paint flows gracefully down the left side of the page, reminiscent of a festive party streamer. Tiny, shimmering gold-leaf style painted hearts are delicately scattered within the watercolor swirl, catching the light. The right side of the page is kept clean to beautifully showcase the message. The text is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. Message text: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are! Love, John, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\". The overall design is sophisticated and artistic, providing a warm and celebratory space for the message. Painted in a watercolor style with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds."
