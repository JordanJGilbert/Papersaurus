    "frontCover": "A funny and lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover. In the center, a cartoon version of a young East Asian couple is depicted. On the left is Lao Lao, a young woman in her early 20s with long, straight dark brown hair parted in the middle, wearing thin round-framed glasses and a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a circular logo. She has a warm, happy smile. On the right is Jordan, a young Southeast Asian man in his early 20s with short, slightly tousled black hair, wearing a tan hoodie. He has his arms around Lao Lao and is smiling broadly with a very happy and cheerful expression. They are both holding oversized, comically large mahjong tiles as if they are shields, playfully getting ready for a friendly \"battle.\" Colorful, festive confetti and streamers float around them. The background is a soft, clean wash of watercolor with artistic paint splatters and organic bleeds on a textured paper background. In the center of the composition, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are elegantly written. --ar 5:7 --style raw --s 150 --v 6.0\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and clean design for a greeting card back cover, in a lighthearted watercolor painting style. The background is a soft, warm tan wash on a textured paper background, with subtle artistic paint bleeds and splatters. A small, simple, and elegant arrangement of mahjong tiles is positioned in the top-left corner as a subtle brand mark. The overall composition is very sparse, with ample negative space. The bottom-right corner is intentionally left blank. --ar 5:7 --style raw --s 150 --v 6.0",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative panel for the left interior of a greeting card, in a lighthearted watercolor painting style. The background is a soft, clean wash of light blue on a textured paper background, with subtle artistic paint bleeds. A beautiful, gentle cascade of colorful watercolor confetti and streamers floats down from the top-left corner towards the center, creating a festive but not overpowering design. The colors are muted tones of tan, blue, and pastel accents. There are no characters or text. --ar 5:7 --style raw --s 150 --v 6.0",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful and minimalist design for the right interior of a greeting card, focusing on text legibility. The background is a very pale, warm off-white with a subtle paper texture and a faint, soft-edged watercolor wash of light tan around the periphery. In the bottom-right corner, there is a small, simple watercolor illustration of a single, cozy blanket, loosely draped. The style is clean and simple, with plenty of open space in the center for a message. --ar 5:7 --style raw --s 150 --v 6.0"
