The artwork features a simple, slightly goofy illustrated character (perhaps an animal like a bear or a dog, sketched with loose, expressive lines) looking slightly flustered by a single, oversized birthday candle on a tiny cupcake. The colors are soft and warm, with a gentle watercolor bleed effect around the edges, giving it an organic, handmade feel.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card with a simple, flat 2D illustration in a cute, slightly minimalist cartoon style. The background is a solid, muted teal color. Centered in the top half of the card are two lines of text in a rounded, sans-serif font, colored a warm, pale yellow. The first line reads \"happy birthday,\" and the second line, slightly smaller and directly below, reads \"craig.\" The main subject is a large, plump, light brown potato character positioned in the lower half of the card, slightly off-center to the left. This potato has two large, round, black and white eyes, and a tiny, curved, dark line for a mouth, giving it a neutral or slightly bewildered expression. It is wearing a small, bright yellow, pointed party hat tilted on its head. The potato has two very simple, thin, dark brown stick legs protruding from its base, angled slightly outward. A subtle, soft shadow is cast directly beneath the potato on the teal background. The overall mood is humorous, endearing, and whimsical.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a minimalist, clean, and charming aesthetic. The background is a soft, muted sage green. Centered in the lower half of the card is a simple, stylized illustration of a small green sprout emerging from a mound of brown soil, with two small brown dots representing seeds within the soil. The sprout has two simple, heart-shaped leaves with thin, dark brown outlines. The overall composition is very sparse, providing a sense of quiet resolution and continuation from the implied front and interior pages. No text or QR code space is visible. The style is consistent with a hand-drawn, flat 2D illustration.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a funny, simple, and smart style. The artwork features a minimalist, flat 2D illustration against a muted green background. Four anthropomorphic root vegetables are lined up against a series of faint, horizontal white lines that suggest a height chart or a lineup. From left to right, a carrot with a worried expression and clasped hands, a sweet potato with crossed arms and an annoyed expression, a potato with a sad expression and clasped hands, and a turnip with a blank, slightly concerned expression. All characters are rendered with simple shapes, bold outlines, and minimal detail, conveying distinct personalities through their expressions and postures. The color palette is limited to earthy tones and soft pastels, creating a cohesive and visually pleasing aesthetic. The overall composition is clean and balanced, emphasizing the humorous depiction of the vegetables' expressions. This scene directly continues the visual narrative, likely setting up a humorous scenario or punchline for the card.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a simple, clean aesthetic. The dominant background is a muted, slightly textured sage green. Across the top and bottom of the page, separated by a thin, horizontal dark gray line, is a repeating pattern of stylized, simple illustrations. These illustrations consist of round, light tan shapes with a few small dark spots, resembling cookies or perhaps planets, alternating with small, white, triangular flag shapes with dark gray outlines, suggestive of tiny party flags or markers. The illustrations are outlined in a thin, dark gray line, matching the horizontal separators. The bottom border also features the \"From, Jordan\" text in a simple, sans-serif font, centered and positioned just above the bottom edge. The overall impression is one of minimalist charm and subtle festivity, designed to leave ample, unobstructed space for a handwritten message. The style is flat 2D artwork, intended for printing. The design is cohesive with a playful, lighthearted tone."
