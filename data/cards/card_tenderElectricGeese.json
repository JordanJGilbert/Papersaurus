    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a warm, inviting storybook watercolor illustration style. The scene is bathed in the soft, golden light of a California afternoon, evoking a feeling of optimism and gentle warmth. The background depicts a stylized representation of the Stanford campus with soft, flowing washes of earthy greens, warm terracotta, and sun-drenched ochre, creating a dreamy, painterly backdrop. Prominently displayed in the upper center is the name \"Jessica Greenwalt\" in elegant, flowing calligraphy script, rendered in rich, warm sepia ink. Above the name is a whimsical, abstract swirl of thin, ink-like lines in a light brown hue. To the left, a charming cartoon character resembling a folded paper object with a worried expression stands near a small, antique-style letterpress printer. The printer is actively printing a sheet of paper with a simple cartoon dinosaur illustration. To the right, two friendly, green cartoon dinosaur characters are depicted. The larger dinosaur, with reddish-brown hair, holds a small framed picture of a cartoon dinosaur. The smaller dinosaur stands beside her, also with a happy expression. The overall composition has a handmade, artisanal feel, full of heart and artistic spirit, with the text \"Thank you - AI for Good Conference\" positioned in a clear, readable manner below the name, integrated into the scene. The art style is flat 2D, suitable for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor illustration style, evoking the soft, golden light of a California afternoon. The scene is a grassy field in front of a building with trees, rendered in washes of earthy greens, warm terracotta, and sun-drenched ochre, creating a dreamy, painterly backdrop. In the foreground, a single, slightly crumpled white paper airplane rests on the grass, with a few scattered pieces of paper around it. The overall impression is serene and peaceful, offering a subtle resolution to the visual narrative of the card. There is no text or QR code present. The composition is minimalist, focusing on the quiet aftermath of a journey or idea, complementing the previous panels without being explicit.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a \"Smart Style\" watercolor illustration. The scene continues the humorous and lighthearted narrative. A cheerful, slightly exasperated green cartoon dinosaur, depicted with whimsical, soft watercolor textures, is entangled in a large, flowing scroll of paper. The paper is coming from a small, gray, retro-style printer that is actively printing. The background is a warm, golden-orange wash, reminiscent of a California sunset, with subtle, abstract swirling shapes in a lighter orange and yellow. The overall composition is dynamic, with the paper scroll creating a sense of movement and playful chaos around the dinosaur. The artistic style is consistent with the front cover, featuring soft edges, visible brushstrokes, and a limited, warm color palette dominated by greens, oranges, and yellows. There is no text or identifying information on this page, allowing the visual storytelling to take center stage.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a beautifully rendered, old-fashioned scroll unfurling across the center. The scroll itself is a soft, parchment-like texture, with subtle watercolor shading that gives it depth. The text, \"Jessica Greenwalt, thank you so much for attending the AI for Good Conference! Your presence helped make the conversation about as epic as a paper-craft dinosaur successfully operating a printer. We hope you left inspired and with slightly fewer paper jams in your life!\", is elegantly printed on the scroll in a warm, sepia-toned, flowing script typography. The entire message area is framed by a stylized, decorative border that mimics flowing ribbons or stylized scrolls, rendered in the same warm, sepia watercolor tones. This border extends inwards, creating a sense of depth and visual interest without overwhelming the message space. The overall color palette is dominated by warm, earthy browns, creamy beiges, and hints of golden ochre, evoking a sophisticated and slightly vintage feel. The artistic style is that of a soft, painterly watercolor illustration, with visible brushstrokes and a gentle blend of colors, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. There is no specific space designated for handwritten messages; the entire central area is occupied by the printed message, making it a focal point."
