    "frontCover": "Greeting card front cover. A humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration of Lao Lao and Jordan on a sunny beach. The scene is full of comedic action. Jordan is comically tangled up in a giant, brightly colored kite string, looking surprised and laughing as the kite soars high above. Lao Lao, holding a celebratory birthday drink with a little umbrella, is laughing heartily at his predicament. They are both transformed into charming cartoon versions of themselves, wearing the same outfits from the reference photo (Lao Lao in a light blue sweatshirt and black pants, Jordan in a tan hoodie and dark pants, logos omitted). The beach is whimsical, with sandcastles shaped like birthday cakes and crabs wearing tiny party hats scuttling by. The ocean is a beautiful blend of turquoise and blue watercolor washes, with gentle waves lapping the shore. In the center of the image, written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\". Flat 2D artwork, soft edges, vibrant watercolor style.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.

    "backCover": "Back of a greeting card. A minimalist and elegant watercolor design featuring two overlapping hearts, subtly painted in the corner. The hearts are rendered in soft washes of light blue and sandy tan, echoing the front cover's color palette. The background is a clean, textured off-white watercolor paper, with very subtle, organic paint bleeds at the edges. The design is positioned in the top-left quadrant, leaving the majority of the card, especially the bottom-right corner, clear. Flat 2D artwork, soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture."
