    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene Pop Art design continuing the theme. The left side of the card features a stylized, graphic olive branch with oversized leaves, rendered with bold black outlines and a vibrant green and hot pink color fill, against a clean white background with subtle light blue Ben-Day dots. This design brings a peaceful, artistic closure, referencing the Greek theme with a modern, energetic twist. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated. The style is consistent with the front cover, using the same bold outlines and saturated color palette of the pop art aesthetic.",
    "frontCover": "A vibrant Pop Art wedding scene in the style of Roy Lichtenstein. A stylized cartoon couple, the man with dark hair and sunglasses, the woman with flowing hair in a simple white dress, stand together smiling. In front of them are two small children: a little girl in a pretty dress holding a basket of flowers, and a little boy holding a small pillow with rings. The background is a simplified, graphic representation of a sun-drenched Greek village in Agrinio, with bold blue and white buildings under a bright yellow sky filled with Ben-Day dots. Speech bubbles appear above the couple. The man's bubble says \"From Smithtown...\" and the woman's bubble says \"...to forever in Agrinio!\" in a comic book font. In the center, the text \"Congratulations Michael & Alexis\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The entire image uses a high-contrast, saturated color palette of cerulean blue, bright yellow, and hot pink, with thick black outlines and halftone patterns.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An energetic Pop Art composition in the style of Andy Warhol. A repeating grid of four panels showcases a stylized, graphic illustration of a jumbo jet airplane. Each panel features the same airplane but in a different vibrant color combination: one is hot pink on a yellow background, the next is cyan on an orange background, the third is lime green on a royal blue background, and the fourth is bright orange on a pink background. A dotted line in a contrasting color traces a path from a stylized apple (representing New York) in the top left corner to a graphic olive branch (representing Greece) in the bottom right corner, connecting the panels and symbolizing the long journey. The entire piece has a silkscreened look with bold colors and graphic flair.",
    "rightInterior": "A stunning Pop Art design framing the wedding message. A large, stylized explosion or 'POW!' graphic, typical of comic book art, radiates from the center of the page. The explosion is filled with vibrant concentric circles of hot pink, bright yellow, and cyan blue, detailed with Ben-Day dots. Inside this dynamic shape, the message is beautifully rendered in an elegant, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels warm and personal. The text reads: \"Dearest Michael and Alexis,\\n\\nYour beautiful family from Smithtown traveled all the way to this incredible day in Greece. Your love story is an inspiration, and we are so honored to celebrate with you as you begin this new chapter together. May your life be as vibrant, joyful, and full of love as your wedding day!\\n\\nAll our love,\\nThe Gilbert Family\". The surrounding area of the card is a clean white, making the central design and message pop dramatically."
