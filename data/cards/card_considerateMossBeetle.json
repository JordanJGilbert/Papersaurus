    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front, whimsical watercolor style with soft edges and flowing colors.\n\n**Scene:** A humorous and bright beach scene. Lao Lao (person on the left in photo) and Jordan (person on the right in photo) are sitting on a sandy beach, using a colorful surfboard laid flat on the sand as their picnic table. They are joyfully eating dim sum together, laughing and looking at each other. Lao Lao is wearing a light blue sweatshirt and Jordan is wearing a tan hoodie, consistent with their photo.\n\n**Details:**\n-   The surfboard is covered with an array of dim sum in open bamboo steamers: siu mai, har gow, and fluffy char siu bao. There are also a couple of cute egg tarts.\n-   Surrounding them are several curious and funny seagulls waddling on the sand. Each seagull is wearing a ridiculously tiny, slightly askew white chef's hat. One ambitious seagull is trying to peek into a steamer basket.\n-   In the background, gentle turquoise ocean waves lap the shore under a sunny sky with soft, wispy clouds. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful with blues, tans, and warm food colors.\n-   Lao Lao is holding a dumpling with chopsticks, smiling happily at Jordan. Jordan is mid-laugh, gesturing towards one of the chef-hat-wearing seagulls.\n\n**Text:**\n-   **Content:** \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\"\n-   **Style:** Positioned in the center of the card. The text is rendered in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, colored in a deep, complementary blue.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. A single, stylized, ridiculously tiny white chef's hat, identical to those worn by the seagulls on the front, sits in the upper center of the card. The background is a soft, warm sand texture. The entire image is a flat 2D illustration in a whimsical watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The color palette is muted, primarily using soft tans and whites, creating a clean and simple design. The bottom right area is intentionally left empty.",
    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed decorative panel for the left interior of a greeting card. The scene is an artistic, abstract depiction of gentle turquoise ocean waves lapping against a sandy shore. A few small, detailed seashells are scattered along the sand in the bottom corner. The overall composition is serene and spacious, serving as a beautiful, unobtrusive background. The style is a flat 2D illustration in a whimsical watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors of turquoise, light blue, and warm tan, featuring artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimalist decorative border for the right interior of a greeting card, designed to frame a handwritten message. A delicate watercolor wash of soft turquoise and sandy tan frames the top and bottom edges of the panel, bleeding softly towards the center but leaving a large, clean off-white space for text. In the bottom right corner, a small, beautifully rendered egg tart sits as a subtle, charming accent. The entire image is a flat 2D illustration in a whimsical watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Hey Lao Lao,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to get you a gift as amazing as you are, but my budget doesn't cover owning a whole planet. I hope you have a day that's almost as wonderful as you are and that involves way too much cake.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
