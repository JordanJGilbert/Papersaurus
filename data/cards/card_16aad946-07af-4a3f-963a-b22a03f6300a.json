    "frontCover": "A vibrant, flat 2D comic book style birthday card front cover. In the center, a cartoon superhero version of \"Sarah,\" based on the reference photo, strikes a dynamic, powerful pose, bursting forward with an energetic aura. She has a determined, joyful expression. In the background, a cartoon version of \"John,\" also based on the reference photo, is depicted in a comical, slightly clumsy sidekick pose, maybe tripping over a cape or juggling a stack of gift boxes precariously. The scene is filled with classic comic book elements: bold black outlines, vibrant primary colors, and a background of Ben-Day dots and action lines like \"BAM!\" and \"POW!\". A large, explosive speech bubble near Sarah's head exclaims \"It's my Super Birthday!\". In the center of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, and bold handwritten cursive script.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A simple, clean back cover in a flat 2D comic book style, visually cohesive with the front. The design features a full-bleed background of vibrant blue Ben-Day dots. In the center, a single, stylized comic book action word, \"ZAP!\", is displayed in a bright yellow and red explosive shape with bold black outlines. The overall design is minimal and clean. No people or characters. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated, maintaining only the blue Ben-Day dot background for QR code placement. All key elements are kept at least 10% away from the top and bottom edges.",
    "leftInterior": "A decorative left interior panel in a vibrant, flat 2D comic book style. The design is a full-bleed, dynamic pattern of colorful, overlapping gift boxes, some wrapped in paper with Ben-Day dots and others in solid primary colors like red, yellow, and blue. The boxes are drawn with bold black outlines and are scattered as if tumbling through the air, with subtle comic-style motion lines trailing them. No people, characters, or text. The artwork is purely decorative and harmonizes with the energetic theme of the front cover, extending to all edges while keeping key elements 10% from the top and bottom.",
    "rightInterior": "A decorative right interior panel in a flat 2D comic book style. The background is a light, cheerful yellow with a subtle Ben-Day dot pattern. The message is written in a beautiful, readable, and bold handwritten cursive script with black ink. The text is framed by comic book art elements: a large, colorful, empty speech bubble playfully positioned at the top left, and a stack of three brightly wrapped gift boxes at the bottom right. The design is clean, allowing the text to be the main focus, while maintaining the comic book aesthetic. No people or characters are depicted. The text and main art elements are kept 0.5 inches from the left/right edges and 10% from the top/bottom edges for safe printing. The message text reads: \"Happy birthday, Sarah! They say you get wiser with age, but I'm just happy we're still young enough to remember where we left our keys. Here's to another year of questionable decisions and laughing way too much!\\n\\nYour partner in crime,\\nJohn\""
