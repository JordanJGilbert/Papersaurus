    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that brings the story to a peaceful close. In the center-left of the card, a single, beautifully detailed golden key, matching the one from the front cover, lies gracefully on a soft wash of pastel pink and lavender watercolor. Delicate, shimmering stardust seems to float gently around the key, painted with subtle metallic watercolor accents. The background is a soft, off-white with visible paper texture and gentle paint bleed effects at the edges. The overall feeling is serene and magical, providing a quiet, artistic conclusion. The bottom-right corner area is left intentionally blank.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor scene. An adorable cartoon baby girl with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, representing Vivi, is shown happily holding a giant, ornate, golden key. The key is comically oversized, almost as big as she is. Next to her, a stylish and happy cartoon grandmother character, representing Audrey, looks on with a surprised but amused expression, hands on her hips. They are standing on a fluffy white cloud, as if in a whimsical, heavenly place. In the background, a soft, pastel watercolor sky with gentle swirls of pink, lavender, and light blue. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday to You... Both!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The entire scene is painted in a soft watercolor style with visible paper texture and artistic paint bleeds, creating a funny narrative that Vivi 'unlocked' her arrival for the shared birthday.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An artistic and whimsical watercolor illustration. A giant, beautifully rendered wall calendar is the central focus. Most of the calendar dates are painted in faint, soft grey watercolor. One square, however, is highlighted dramatically with a bright, golden watercolor wash, radiating light. Inside this golden square, two cheerful, cartoonish birthday cakes are depicted side-by-side, one slightly larger than the other, both with glowing candles. Playful confetti and tiny stars, painted in vibrant pastel colors, seem to burst from this highlighted date, scattering across the page. The design humorously emphasizes the 'one special day' for two special people, rendered in a soft watercolor style with artistic brush strokes and paper texture.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design frames the heartfelt message. The background is a soft, warm cream with visible paper texture. A whimsical, swirling ribbon of pastel pink, blue, and gold watercolor paint flows elegantly from the top-left corner down towards the bottom-right, creating a dynamic and artistic border. Interspersed within the ribbon are tiny, shimmering painted stars and delicate, abstract confetti shapes that echo the design from the left interior page. The overall effect is celebratory and sophisticated without being cluttered. In the center, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, elegant handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday, Audrey! We're starting to think Vivi planned her arrival just so she could share the spotlight with her amazing grandmother. We hope your day is as wonderful as you are!\\n\\nLove,\\nJohn, Christina, Jasmine, and Jordan\""
