    "backCover": "A beautiful, minimalist full-bleed watercolor background that continues the serene pasture theme from the front cover. The design features the soft green grass at the bottom third and the pale blue sky with a few wispy white clouds at the top. In the bottom-left corner, a small, charming detail: a few loose, fluffy tufts of white sheep's wool are gently scattered on the green grass, as if left behind by the sheep from the front cover. The entire image is rendered in the same flat 2D cartoon style with soft, flowing watercolor colors, visible artistic brushstrokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely clear of any elements, featuring only the plain watercolor texture of the grass.",
    "frontCover": "A charming and funny watercolor painting of a very round, fluffy sheep attempting to gracefully leap over a small wooden fence, but it's hilariously stuck halfway, with its front legs dangling on one side and its back legs kicking comically in the air. The sheep has a slightly bewildered and sheepish expression on its face. The scene is set in a soft, green pasture under a pale blue sky with a few wispy clouds. In the center, elegantly scripted in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive font, is the text \"Hope your birthday is un-baa-lievably fun!\". The artwork should have a flat 2D cartoon style, rendered with soft, flowing watercolor colors, visible artistic brushstrokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges of the figures and background elements.",
    "leftInterior": "A simple and elegant full-bleed decorative art piece that harmonizes with the card's theme. The design features a continuous watercolor landscape of the rolling green pasture under the pale blue sky, matching the style of the front cover. Floating gently across the scene are several individual, fluffy white clouds and a few soft, white wool tufts, creating a light and airy pattern. The artwork maintains the flat 2D cartoon watercolor style, with soft flowing colors, visible brushstrokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges, providing a cohesive and artistic interior that complements the main illustration.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful full-bleed watercolor background of the green pasture and pale blue sky, consistent with the rest of the card's artwork. In the center of the panel, elegantly scripted in the same beautiful, handwritten cursive font from the front cover, is the message: \"Don't get stuck on counting the years! Have a wonderful day!\". The text is framed by delicate, artistic watercolor elements: a few wispy clouds float near the top, and a small cluster of fluffy white wool tufts rests on the green grass below the text. The entire composition is rendered in the flat 2D cartoon watercolor style with soft colors, visible brushstrokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, ensuring all key elements are at least 10% away from the edges."
