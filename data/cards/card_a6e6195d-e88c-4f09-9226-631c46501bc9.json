    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene decorative design on a soft pastel yellow background, providing peaceful closure. A single, elegant teal line snakes gracefully from the left side towards the center, culminating in a small, stylized musical note and a tiny lightning bolt, subtly referencing the front cover's theme. The design is simple, artistic, and occupies the upper-left and central part of the card, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty and undecorated. The overall feeling is clean, modern, and subtly playful, maintaining the card's cohesive color palette and whimsical style.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted 2D cartoon illustration featuring three stylized, charming characters. In the center, a cheerful older character with a party hat is comically tangled in a giant, old-fashioned hearing aid trumpet, looking surprised. On either side, two other characters, one male and one female, are laughing good-naturedly. The scene is set against a clean, soft pastel yellow background with whimsical, floating musical notes and small, stylized lightning bolts to represent creaking sounds. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The art style is flat and playful, with simple shapes and a warm, vibrant color palette of yellow, teal, and coral. Key elements are kept away from the edges for safe printing.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "A full-bleed, abstract 2D illustration representing the concept of 'sound' in a playful, artistic way. On a soft pastel yellow background, a symphony of visual elements creates a dynamic composition. Curving teal lines, resembling sound waves, flow across the page. Interspersed are small, coral-colored lightning bolt shapes, representing sharp 'creaks', and whimsical, floating musical notes of various sizes. The design is a non-literal, artistic interpretation of sound and movement, using the same color palette (yellow, teal, coral) and flat, clean style as the rest of the card, creating a visually interesting and humorous pattern that complements the joke on the right.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed page featuring the handwritten message on a clean, soft pastel yellow background. The text is framed by an innovative decorative border composed of stylized, cartoonish joints and bones\u2014like knees and elbows\u2014drawn in a simple, elegant teal outline style. From these illustrated joints, small, coral-colored musical notes and tiny lightning bolt 'creak' marks emanate playfully. The message is written in the center in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script: \"Happy birthday! I was going to get you one of those cards that makes a sound, but I figured you hear enough creaking and groaning from your own joints already. Hope you have a fantastic day!\". The design is clever, artistic, and directly illustrates the humor of the message in a smart, stylish way, keeping key elements safely away from the edges."
