    "frontCover": "A beautiful and humorous birthday card front, watercolor painting style. A funny scene featuring two young people, Jordan and their partner, attempting to bake a birthday cake for their Lao Lao. The kitchen is in a state of chaos, with flour dust everywhere and icing splattered on their faces and clothes, but they are laughing joyfully.\n\nIn the center, a 20-25 year old East Asian woman with long, straight black hair and thin-rimmed glasses, wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with 'ROCKY MOUNTAIN' logo, holds a mixing bowl, smiling warmly. Standing behind her, a 20-25 year old Southeast Asian man with short, textured black hair, wearing a tan hoodie and maroon sweatpants, has his arms around her, smiling broadly as he helps stir the batter, accidentally flicking some onto her nose.\n\nThe words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script in the safe center area of the composition.\n\nThe artwork is a flat 2D illustration in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible artistic brushstrokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. The overall tone is lighthearted and full of love. --ar 5:7 --style raw --s 150 --v 6.0 --seed 2783\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
