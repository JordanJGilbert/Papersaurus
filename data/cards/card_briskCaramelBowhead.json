    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a bold Pop Art style, inspired by Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. The artwork features a stylized, comic-book illustration of a woman with vibrant blonde, curly hair, large expressive eyes, and bright red lips. She is wearing large headphones and a chunky silver chain necklace. A bright yellow lightbulb with emanating rays signifies an idea or accomplishment. Musical notes and binary code (1010101010) are depicted as flowing around her head, suggesting the \"learned a lot\" theme. The text \"Congratulations\" is rendered in a dynamic, starburst-shaped speech bubble, colored in a contrasting yellow with a black outline, and filled with a clear, elegant cursive font. The background is a split design: the upper portion is a bright blue with musical notes and a subtle circular pattern, while the lower portion is a peach color with a halftone dot pattern. The overall color palette is vibrant and energetic, with strong contrasts between yellow, blue, peach, and black. The composition is dynamic, with the character positioned slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's eye towards the \"Congratulations\" text and the lightbulb.
