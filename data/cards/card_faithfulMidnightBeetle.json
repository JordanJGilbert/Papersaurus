    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front, whimsical watercolor style with soft edges and flowing colors.\n\n**Scene:** A humorous and bright beach scene. Lao Lao (person on the left in photo) and Jordan (person on the right in photo) are sitting on a sandy beach, using a colorful surfboard laid flat on the sand as their picnic table. They are joyfully eating dim sum together, laughing and looking at each other. Lao Lao is wearing a light blue sweatshirt and Jordan is wearing a tan hoodie, consistent with their photo.\n\n**Details:**\n-   The surfboard is covered with an array of dim sum in open bamboo steamers: siu mai, har gow, and fluffy char siu bao. There are also a couple of cute egg tarts.\n-   Surrounding them are several curious and funny seagulls waddling on the sand. Each seagull is wearing a ridiculously tiny, slightly askew white chef's hat. One ambitious seagull is trying to peek into a steamer basket.\n-   In the background, gentle turquoise ocean waves lap the shore under a sunny sky with soft, wispy clouds. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful with blues, tans, and warm food colors.\n-   Lao Lao is holding a dumpling with chopsticks, smiling happily at Jordan. Jordan is mid-laugh, gesturing towards one of the chef-hat-wearing seagulls.\n\n**Text:**\n-   **Content:** \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\"\n-   **Style:** Positioned in the center of the card. The text is rendered in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, colored in a deep, complementary blue.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card, in a flat 2D watercolor painting style. A single, stylized dim sum dumpling, like a har gow or siu mai, is painted in the top center of the composition. The dumpling is rendered with soft flowing colors and artistic brush strokes, using warm yellows and subtle oranges. The background is a plain, solid cream color with a visible paper texture and subtle, organic paint bleeds around the edges. The overall design is very clean and simple, with about 80% negative space, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty for a logo or code.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful and subtle decorative illustration for the left interior of a greeting card, in a flat 2D whimsical watercolor style. The scene depicts a quiet sandy shoreline. Gentle turquoise waves with soft white foam lap against a tan-colored sandy beach. A few assorted seashells are scattered artistically along the sand in the foreground. The entire composition is rendered with soft flowing colors, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. There are no people, animals, or text. The design is calm and complementary, occupying roughly the bottom 40% of the panel, leaving the top portion as clear sky.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimal and elegant design for the right interior of a greeting card, created to beautifully frame a written message. A simple, artistic watercolor wash of soft sandy tan and gentle turquoise blue bleeds in from the bottom-right corner, creating a subtle decorative accent. A few tiny, whimsical watercolor dots in a warm golden-yellow are scattered lightly within the colored corner. The style is flat 2D with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds. The majority of the panel is a clean, off-white background, providing ample, open space for a handwritten message. The decoration is minimal, occupying no more than 20% of the total area.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"Hey Lao Lao,\n\nHappy birthday! I was going to get you a gift as amazing as you are, but my budget doesn't cover owning a whole planet. I hope you have a day that's almost as wonderful as you are and that involves way too much cake.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
