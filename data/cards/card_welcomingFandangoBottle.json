    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a watercolor artistic style. The color palette is warm and vibrant, featuring shades of yellow, orange, and light brown, with some muted blues and reds. The main subjects are two cartoon children, a girl with glasses and long dark hair wearing a blue sweater and jeans, and a boy with short dark hair wearing an orange hoodie and brown pants. They are both depicted in mid-stride, running joyfully. Above them floats a large slice of pepperoni pizza, emitting wavy lines to indicate heat. Small orange stars and red hearts are scattered throughout the background, adding a playful and affectionate feel. The text \"Jordan\" is placed to the left of the girl, and \"Lae Lao\" to the right of the boy, in a simple, slightly rounded, dark brown font. The primary text, \"I Love You More Than Pizza,\" is prominently displayed at the bottom of the card in a decorative, flowing, dark brown script font. The composition is dynamic, with the children and pizza forming a triangular shape, and the text anchoring the bottom. The overall mood is cheerful, affectionate, and whimsical.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a soft watercolor artistic style, complementing a front cover likely featuring a similar aesthetic. The background is a textured, off-white or very pale cream, reminiscent of watercolor paper. On the left side, there is a gentle, flowing brushstroke in a gradient of soft peach to light yellow, curving upwards. Emerging from the tip of this brushstroke are three small, golden-yellow watercolor stars, with one slightly larger than the others, and a few tiny golden dots scattered around them, suggesting a subtle sparkle or trailing stardust. The composition is minimalist, with the decorative elements concentrated in the upper left quadrant, leaving ample negative space on the right. There is no visible text or QR code on this back cover, offering a clean and understated closure to the card's visual narrative, focusing on the whimsical and gentle theme established by the artwork.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a whimsical watercolor illustration. A red and white striped paper container for french fries is tilted, with golden-yellow french fries spilling out and curving downwards towards the lower right of the page. Scattered below and trailing from the fries are numerous small, solid red hearts of varying sizes, arranged in a loose, flowing pattern. The background is a soft, textured cream or pale yellow, with subtle watercolor washes and faint, scattered speckles of orange and reddish-brown paint, suggesting a warm, inviting atmosphere and the characteristic bloom of watercolor paint. The overall artistic style is charming and illustrative, with soft edges and a slightly impressionistic feel. The colors are warm and inviting, with the vibrant yellow of the fries and the deep red of the hearts creating a pleasing contrast against the muted background. The composition is dynamic, with the diagonal flow of the fries and hearts leading the viewer's eye across the page. There is no visible text on this page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a light cream watercolor paper background. The left side features a large, abstract watercolor swirl in shades of light blue and grey, creating a gentle, artistic border. Within this swirl, the words \"deep\" and \"poetic\" are written in a loose, cursive, dark blue watercolor font, adding to the artistic feel. The main message area occupies the central and right portions of the card and is left largely blank for handwriting, creating ample space. The text \"Lao Lao, I was going to write something deep and poetic, but then I realized I'm way better at stealing your fries and making you laugh. I love you more than pizza, and that's saying a lot. All my love, Jordan\" is printed in a dark, thin, cursive font. To the upper right, a red cardboard container overflowing with golden french fries is illustrated in a whimsical watercolor style, with small orange splatters around it suggesting heat or flavor. Below the fries, a slice of pepperoni pizza is depicted in watercolor, with a golden crust and red pepperoni circles. The right side of the card is further embellished with scattered, glowing yellow and orange star shapes and small dots, also rendered in watercolor, creating a cheerful and celebratory atmosphere. The words \"laugh\" and \"pizza\" are prominently displayed in bold, colorful watercolor lettering. \"Laugh\" is in a vibrant blue, and \"pizza\" is in a warm red and orange. In the bottom left corner, beneath the watercolor swirls, the word \"Sonnet\" is written in the same dark blue cursive as \"deep\" and \"poetic.\" The overall artistic style is reminiscent of loose, expressive watercolor, balancing decorative elements with clear, open space for personal messages."
