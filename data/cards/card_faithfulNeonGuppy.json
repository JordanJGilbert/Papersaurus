In the foreground, a person wearing a dark blue graduation cap and gown stands with their back to the viewer, looking out over a landscape. The landscape includes rolling green hills, distant trees, and iconic university buildings illuminated with warm, soft lights. A prominent bell tower, reminiscent of Sather Tower, stands tall on the right side of the image, bathed in the twilight glow. Above the central text, a golden laurel wreath encircles a constellation, hinting at the Gemini constellation. The text \"Congratulations, Simoni\" is written in elegant, flowing gold script, centered in the upper half of the image.

    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a graduation greeting card, in a warm, painterly watercolor style, featuring a celestial theme. The background is a deep, rich indigo blue, reminiscent of a night sky, subtly textured with wisps of nebula in muted purples and pinks. Scattered across the dark expanse are tiny, delicate white stars, some appearing as single points, others as faint clusters. Dominating the center of the composition, slightly off-center to the left, is a beautifully rendered, antique-looking golden astrolabe. The astrolabe is intricate and detailed, with multiple concentric rings, pointers, and marked gradations, all rendered in a rich, burnished gold that catches the subtle light. The overall effect is one of timeless wisdom, exploration, and the vast potential of the future, aligning with the \"Smart Style\" and \"Traditional\" tone. The imagery is static, evoking a sense of contemplative wonder. The entire image is a full-bleed composition, with no visible borders.
