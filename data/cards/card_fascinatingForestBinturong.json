The central figure is a stylish, confident woman of color with dark, upswept hair, winking playfully. She is wearing a sharp, royal blue blazer over a low-cut top and a statement pearl necklace. Her left hand is raised, holding a martini glass, while her right hand is on her hip. The background features stylized, abstract city skyline elements rendered in soft watercolor washes of grey and muted yellow. Prominently displayed across the lower half of the card, in a large, elegant, silver-script font with a subtle glitter effect, is the text \\\"You a professional Baddie\\\".

The art style emphasizes clean ink lines with energetic, expressive watercolor fills, giving a dynamic and glamorous feel.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card featuring a minimalist, artistic design that complements the front cover's fashion illustration style. The background is a soft, creamy texture with subtle watercolor washes in muted grey and yellow, mirroring the front. In the upper left quadrant, a single, elegantly rendered martini glass is depicted, its outline in black ink with faint watercolor fills. Across the central and left portion of the card, a delicate, abstract pattern of thin, meandering black ink lines flows, subtly suggesting the city skyline motif from the front. There is no text on the back cover. The lower right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely clear and undecorated for a QR code. The mood is serene and sophisticated, offering a gentle artistic conclusion.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card in a fashion illustration style, maintaining the bold, hand-drawn aesthetic and watercolor washes. The color palette consists of royal blue, muted grey, soft yellow, and creamy white. The design features an abstract composition of stylized geometric shapes and flowing ink lines that hint at architectural elements, possibly inspired by skyscrapers, rendered in the same muted watercolor palette as the front cover's background. A subtle, repeated motif of a martini glass silhouette might be incorporated in a small, understated manner. The overall effect is dynamic and artistic, providing a visually engaging, text-free space that harmonizes with the card's theme of sophisticated confidence, without featuring any human figures.\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"Right interior of a greeting card, featuring the same fashion illustration style, watercolor washes, and color palette as the front cover.

    "backCover": "Back cover design for a \"professional baddie\" greeting card, inspired by a fashion illustration style with vibrant watercolor washes. The background is a clean, creamy, textured paper. The design features a delicate, gray paper airplane in the lower-left quadrant, gracefully soaring upwards and to the right. Trailing behind the paper airplane are soft, flowing watercolor washes of sky blue and golden yellow, creating a sense of movement and warmth. The overall composition is minimalist and serene, offering a peaceful resolution to the card's visual story. The colors are subtle and sophisticated, complementing the implied bold style of the interior and front of the card, but offering a gentler, more reflective conclusion.

The overall impression is sophisticated, airy, and personalized, with the abstract, organic elements creating a unique and understated decorative frame for the heartfelt message. The style is a refined interpretation of a fashion illustration with watercolor washes, emphasizing a sophisticated yet sassy aesthetic."
