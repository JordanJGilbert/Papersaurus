    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, in a watercolor painting style. The scene depicts a tranquil beach at dusk. A solitary, simple, 2D silhouette of a young person with eyes closed, facing upwards, stands on the shore, looking towards the sky. The sky is a gradient of deep blue transitioning into vibrant pinks and purples, speckled with numerous bright white stars and subtle constellations. A gentle, sparkling ocean with soft waves fills the lower half of the image, rendered in various shades of aqua blue with white highlights. Three glowing, stylized sea turtles are depicted swimming in the shallow water near the shore. The word \"Congratulations\" is written in elegant, white, handwritten cursive script across the upper portion of the sky, positioned safely within the central area. The overall mood is peaceful, inspiring, and dreamlike, with a sparkling and uplifting atmosphere.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a watercolor painting style, featuring a soft, gradient wash of deep to light blues that fades into white in the lower right corner. At the top center, a stylized, white, sparkling compass rose is depicted, with a delicate trail of small, scattered white sparkles forming a circular path around it, suggesting navigation and magic. The overall impression is peaceful, serene, and subtly inspiring, with ample empty space in the bottom right for a QR code, keeping the decorative elements primarily in the upper and central areas. The artistic style is consistent with a watercolor painting, characterized by soft brushstrokes, organic color blends, and a subtle paper texture, creating a cohesive and emotionally resonant conclusion to a visual story.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a watercolor painting style, depicting a serene aquatic scene transitioning into a vibrant cityscape. The top third of the image features a stylized, dark blue silhouette of a New York-like city skyline against a deep, speckled night sky with twinkling, sparse white dots suggesting stars or gentle snowfall. Below this urban silhouette, a wide expanse of aqua-colored ocean dominates the middle section, rendered with flowing, wavy brushstrokes and soft color gradients of turquoise and teal. A subtle golden shimmer weaves through the waves, and a school of small, simple, silhouette-style fish swim in formation towards the right. The bottom third of the image reveals a San Francisco-inspired cityscape silhouette, with a prominent bridge and rolling hills in the background. This lower cityscape is rendered in muted teal tones, overlaying a network of glowing, thin golden lines that represent technology and data flow. These lines connect minimalist icons: a cogwheel, a starburst symbol, a lightbulb, a simple computer monitor, and upward-trending graph lines, all outlined in thin, bright gold. The overall color palette is cohesive, with deep blues, bright aquas, and golden highlights, creating an uplifting and inspiring mood. The artistic style emphasizes soft watercolor textures, visible brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, all contributing to a heartfelt and emotional tone. The composition is designed for a 9:16 aspect ratio, with a full-bleed background. There is no text or people on this interior page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a watercolor painting style. The background is a serene, ethereal blend of aqua and teal watercolors with soft, flowing brushstrokes and subtle paper texture. Emerging from the top left is a beautiful, stylized sea turtle, rendered in shades of turquoise and teal, with a delicate gold constellation pattern on its shell. A shimmering trail of gold glitter and stardust follows the turtle, curving gently towards the center of the page. The handwritten message, \"Mele Sing your true song Travel with your heart Trust your heart\", is elegantly presented in a flowing, cursive script in a deep teal or dark green ink. The text is positioned to the right of the turtle, with \"Mele\" at the top, and the subsequent lines centered and stacked below. The overall composition is uplifting, inspiring, and heartfelt, with the sparkly gold elements adding a touch of magic and wonder. The art style is consistent with soft watercolor washes, visible brushwork, and organic paint bleeds, creating a cohesive and dreamlike atmosphere. The prompt should incorporate these elements with a focus on the specific arrangement and artistic rendering of the turtle, the shimmering golden accents, and the placement and style of the handwritten message, all within the specified watercolor aesthetic."
