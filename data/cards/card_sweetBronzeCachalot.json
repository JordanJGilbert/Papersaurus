    "frontCover": "A minimalist, flat 2D cartoon illustration for a greeting card front cover, featuring plenty of clean white space. In the center, two cute, playful characters inspired by the reference photo are depicted with simple shapes and clean lines. The first character, representing John, is playfully chasing the second character, representing Lauren, who is looking back with a joyful, energetic laugh. Both characters are simplified, stylized interpretations, capturing their essence in a fun, minimalist style. Floating between them, positioned safely in the center of the card, is the word \"birthday\" written in a beautiful, elegant, and readable handwritten cursive script. The overall design is sophisticated, fun, and energetic, conveying a sense of playful celebration.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist flat 2D cartoon illustration for a greeting card back cover, maintaining the clean, sophisticated, and fun style from the front. The design features a serene, mostly white background. In the upper center, a small, playful cluster of abstract confetti-like shapes and a few delicate, elegant swirls echo the energetic theme from the front cover in a very subtle way. The colors are identical to the front cover palette. The overall feeling is calm and clean, providing a peaceful conclusion to the card's design. The entire bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and undecorated, with a clean white background, for QR code placement. There are no people or characters in this design.",
    "leftInterior": "A creative and decorative flat 2D cartoon illustration for the left interior of a greeting card, harmonizing with the fun and energetic style of the front cover. The design features a dynamic, abstract pattern of playful swirls, swooshes, and confetti-like shapes that seem to burst from the bottom-left corner and sweep elegantly across the page towards the top-right. The artwork uses the same clean lines, simple shapes, and cohesive color palette as the front cover, creating a visually continuous and joyful experience. The design is purely decorative and artistic, containing no people, characters, or text, serving as a beautiful, energetic backdrop that complements the overall theme.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful flat 2D cartoon illustration for the right interior of a greeting card, integrating a heartfelt message with decorative art that matches the fun and energetic style of the front cover. The design features subtle, abstract decorative elements\u2014like soft swirls and delicate confetti shapes from the front cover\u2014framing the corners of the card, primarily the top-left and bottom-right, leaving a large, clean central area for the text. This artwork uses the same color palette and minimalist style, enhancing the message without overwhelming it. Centered safely away from all edges, the following message is written in a beautiful, elegant, and perfectly readable handwritten cursive script with high contrast against the clean background: \"John!\\nHope your birthday is bursting with as much fun and silliness as this card! May your whole day be filled with cake, laughter, and your favorite things. You're the best!\\n\\nAll my best,\\nLauren\". The layout ensures the text is the primary focus, appearing clear, legible, and heartfelt. The design contains no people or characters."
