For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. I have included my own reference image. Create a stylized cartoon/illustrated character inspired by the reference image - DO NOT make realistic depictions of real people, instead create charming cartoon-style characters with simplified, friendly features. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n2. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\nVISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:\n- Same color palette across all sections\n- Consistent lighting/time of day\n- Same artistic techniques and brushwork\n- Recurring visual motifs or symbols (but make them unique and memorable!)\n- Progressive emotional journey from introduction to resolution\n- Front cover: stylized cartoon/illustrated characters if people are needed for the theme\n- Left interior: CREATIVE FREEDOM but NO PEOPLE unless user specifically requested people in their description\n- Right interior: focus on message space with innovative decorative elements (NO PEOPLE)\n- Back cover: simple yet creative decorative design without text or people\n- Use simplified, friendly, charming character design if including people (front cover only)\n- CREATIVITY PRIORITY: Always choose the more innovative, surprising, and memorable option over generic designs\n\nReturn JSON:\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"detailed prompt with story opening elements\",\n  \"backCover\": \"detailed prompt with story conclusion elements\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Create a completely unique and different interpretation for this specific card variant. Use different creative approaches, color schemes, compositions, and artistic elements while maintaining the same core theme and requirements.",

A stylized, happy cartoon couple holds hands while balancing on a log bridge over a clear, flowing stream. The woman wears glasses and a green jacket over a rust-colored top and blue jeans. The man wears an orange t-shirt and blue jeans. Behind them, a gentle waterfall cascades through lush green foliage and trees. To the upper left, a fluffy brown squirrel sits on a tree branch, holding an acorn. The background is filled with soft, blended greens and yellows, suggesting a sunny, natural environment. The text \\\"Happy Birthday!\\\" is written in elegant, flowing black cursive script, centered in the upper half of the image, with ample safe space from the edges. The overall mood is lighthearted, adventurous, and celebratory, with the watercolor textures and soft colors contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a birthday greeting card, watercolor painting style, with a serene and subtly creative decorative design. The design features soft, organic watercolor washes in muted greens and earthy browns, evoking the natural setting from the front cover.

The focus is on an artistic, uncluttered aesthetic, with decorative elements concentrated towards the center and left side, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear for a QR code. The overall mood is peaceful and complementary to the front cover, offering a subtle and artistic conclusion to the visual story.\"\n}\n```",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday greeting card with a whimsical watercolor style. The scene depicts a continuation of a peaceful forest setting with soft, blended washes of greens for foliage in the background. A gentle, flowing stream with muted blue and green tones occupies the lower portion of the image, with subtle watercolor-textured rocks along its banks. The log from the front cover is no longer the central focus, but its presence is implied by the continuation of the natural environment. The overall color palette is serene and nature-inspired, with emphasis on earthy greens and soft blues, maintaining a consistent, light-filled atmosphere. The artistic style features visible watercolor brushstrokes and organic paint bleeds, creating a gentle, dreamy effect. There are no people or text on this back cover; the design focuses purely on natural, harmonious elements to provide a tranquil conclusion to the card's narrative. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is intentionally left clear and undecorated to accommodate a QR code. The decorative elements are subtly placed towards the center and left side, creating a balanced yet open composition.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card, in a whimsical watercolor style. The scene depicts a serene forest setting with lush green foliage and soft, diffused sunlight filtering through the trees. A rough-hewn log serves as a bridge over a gently flowing stream, rendered in soft blues and greens with subtle ripple textures. On the log, a single acorn, wearing a small, festive party hat with a subtle yellow and white speckled pattern, is positioned centrally. The overall color palette is dominated by earthy greens, warm browns, and tranquil blues, all rendered with soft brushstrokes and organic paint bleeds characteristic of watercolor. The composition is simple yet charming, creating a peaceful and subtly humorous atmosphere, implying a quiet woodland celebration. The background trees are softly blurred, drawing focus to the central element of the acorn on the log. The image has a full-bleed background with no text present on this interior page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical, nature-themed watercolor illustration. The background features a soft, out-of-focus watercolor wash of lush green foliage and hints of a distant waterfall, echoing the front cover's scene. A stylized, hand-painted border in a soft, earthy brown or moss green frames the main illustration and extends around the page. This border is not a stark line, but rather a gentle, painterly flourish with subtle watercolor texture and soft, bleeding edges, perhaps with delicate leaf or vine motifs incorporated in a very understated way. The central area of the page is intentionally left open and clean to provide ample space for a handwritten message. The overall color palette is dominated by warm greens, soft browns, and muted blues, maintaining the cheerful and naturalistic tone established on the front. The artistic style is consistent with the front cover's watercolor technique, featuring visible brush strokes and organic paint textures. There is no printed text on this interior page, allowing for personalization. The design aims to create a visually appealing, yet unobtrusive, backdrop for the recipient's personal message, seamlessly continuing the story from the front cover without overwhelming the space meant for writing."
