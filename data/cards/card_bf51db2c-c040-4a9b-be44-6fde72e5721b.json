    "backCover": "A serene watercolor painting showing a single, glowing heart-shaped firefly from the front cover, now resting gently on a delicate, blooming night jasmine vine. The background is a soft, minimalist wash of the same deep blue and purple hues from the night sky on the front cover, with a few distant, twinkling stars. The design is simple and elegant, focused on the left and center, leaving the bottom-right corner clear for a QR code. The mood is peaceful and conclusive, a quiet end to the magical evening. The artwork features soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.",
    "frontCover": "A romantic watercolor painting of two stylized cartoon figures, a man (Jason) and a woman (Sarah), dancing together on a rooftop under a starry night sky. They are holding each other close, captured in a sweet, gentle embrace. The cityscape below is a soft, dreamlike wash of blues, purples, and pinks. Floating around them are glowing, heart-shaped fireflies, casting a warm, magical light. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday to my everything\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The style is soft watercolor with visible paper texture, soft flowing colors, and organic paint bleeds, creating a dreamy and loving atmosphere.",
    "leftInterior": "An artistic and abstract watercolor interpretation of a heart-shaped constellation map. The background is a deep indigo and magenta wash, filled with soft, glowing star clusters and delicate, swirling nebulae that subtly form the shape of a large, encompassing heart. The 'stars' are rendered with splatters of gold and silver paint, and thin, elegant white ink lines connect them to form imaginative constellations of shared memories: a tiny coffee cup, a crescent moon, a musical note. The overall effect is magical, deeply personal, and cosmic, evoking a sense of a shared universe between two people. The style is watercolor with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design where a delicate, shimmering nebula in shades of pink, purple, and gold gracefully swirls around the central area, creating a celestial frame. Within this cosmic border, on a clean, soft white background, the message is written in an elegant, legible, and warm handwritten cursive script. The text reads: \"Bob, Happy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I realized I didn't want to be reminded that I'm right there with you. Hope you have a fantastic day! - Alex\". Tiny, glowing star-like specks are scattered tastefully around the script, linking visually to the left interior. The style is soft watercolor with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and a romantic, heartfelt feel."
