These floral elements are soft and ethereal, with visible brushstrokes that add to the heartfelt and artisanal feel. The overall composition is balanced, with the floral accents framing the text without overpowering it, ensuring the message remains the focal point. The style is consistent with a gentle, painterly watercolor, evoking warmth and tenderness."
