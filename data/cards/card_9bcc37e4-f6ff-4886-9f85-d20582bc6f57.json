    "backCover": "A minimalist and serene pop art design providing a peaceful conclusion. Against a solid sunshine yellow background with subtle, large-scale halftone dots, a single, stylized Greek bougainvillea vine rendered in vibrant magenta with bold black outlines gracefully curls up the left side of the card. A few stylized white doves, drawn with simple, thick black lines, fly from the vine towards the center. The design is clean, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty and undecorated. The overall feeling is one of romantic tranquility, echoing the main color palette and motifs in a quiet, artistic way.",
    "frontCover": "A vibrant pop art wedding scene set against the iconic white buildings and blue domes of Santorini, Greece. The style is reminiscent of Roy Lichtenstein, with bold primary colors (cobalt blue, sunshine yellow, vibrant magenta), thick black outlines, and prominent Ben-Day dots for texture. In the center, a stylized cartoon couple, inspired by the reference, stands joyfully. The groom, a man with black hair and sunglasses, wears a sharp black suit. The bride, a woman with flowing brown hair, wears an elegant white wedding dress. Flanking them are two small, smiling children: a little flower girl in a yellow dress tossing pink petals, and a young ring bearer in a miniature suit holding a blue velvet pillow. The background features a split-panel comic book effect, one panel showing the Aegean Sea and the other the whitewashed architecture. In the upper central area, the text \"Congratulations Michael & Alexis\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, yet clear handwritten cursive script, rendered in a bright red. The entire scene is full of energy, love, and graphic impact, setting a joyful, romantic tone.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided multiple reference photos as input images.

    "leftInterior": "An abstract pop art explosion of romantic symbols, styled like an Andy Warhol silkscreen print. The design features a repeating grid pattern of four large squares, each with a different color background: cobalt blue, sunshine yellow, vibrant magenta, and pure white. Inside each square is the same central image: two interlocking wedding rings, rendered with bold, graphic black lines. The rings in each square are filled with a contrasting pop art color. The background of the entire page is subtly textured with fine halftone dots, creating a cohesive piece that is both modern and emotionally resonant, capturing the joyful repetition of love and commitment.",
    "rightInterior": "A dynamic pop art composition designed to frame the heartfelt message. The background is a bright cobalt blue with a subtle white Ben-Day dot pattern. On the left side of the page, a graphic, comic-book-style heart shape \"bursts\" with radiating yellow and magenta lines, creating an energetic focal point. The message is elegantly integrated within a large, white, cloud-like speech bubble that dominates the center of the page. The text is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script with a natural, flowing pen-style appearance: \"Dearest Michael and Alexis,\\n\\nYour beautiful family from Smithtown traveled all the way to this incredible day in Greece. Your love story is an inspiration, and we are so honored to celebrate with you as you begin this new chapter together. May your life be as vibrant, joyful, and full of love as your wedding day!\\n\\nAll our love,\\nThe Gilbert Family\". The design is clean, bold, and frames the personal message as the star of the show, full of love and pop art energy."
