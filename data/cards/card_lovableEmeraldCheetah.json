    "frontCover": "Here are the detailed prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing anniversary greeting card, based on the provided image and context:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"Front cover of a 9:16 greeting card featuring a stylized, dreamy fantasy anime style. The illustration depicts two charming, simplified cartoon characters, a couple, holding hands and standing on a floating island-like structure.

They are positioned towards the bottom center of the card, leaving ample space above for text. The background is a breathtaking sky filled with soft, swirling clouds in shades of pink, orange, and purple, reminiscent of a sunset, with tiny sparkling stars. A large, luminous dandelion-like seed head with glowing light bursts, symbolizing a bright future, is visible behind the couple on the right. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with soft pastels and a gentle, romantic glow. The text \\\"Happy Anniversary\\\" is prominently displayed in the upper central area of the card in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script in a warm golden yellow color, perfectly complementing the sky's hues. The artwork should have a flat 2D appearance suitable for printing, with full-bleed backgrounds. Ensure faces and key elements are at least 10% away from the top/bottom edges and 0.5\\\" from left/right edges.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a 9:16 greeting card, continuing the dreamy fantasy anime style with a warm color palette. The design is minimalist and serene, focusing on subtle, unexpected artistic elements that evoke a peaceful closure. The primary visual is a continuation of the glowing, dandelion-like seed head motif from the front cover, depicted softly in the upper left and center of the card against a gradient sky of soft purples and pinks, with a few scattered, faint stars. Delicate, shimmering light particles or wisps of glowing mist subtly drift across the scene, adding to the magical atmosphere. There are no characters or text on this panel. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is kept completely clear and undecorated for a QR code. The overall mood is tranquil and sweet, harmonizing with the front cover.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a 9:16 greeting card, in a dreamy fantasy anime style with a warm, romantic color palette. This panel showcases a vibrant, expanding visual narrative. The scene features a stylized, winding path made of glowing, golden light particles leading upwards through a soft, ethereal sky. Along the path, subtly integrated, are clusters of luminous, stylized flowers that bloom in warm hues of peach, rose, and gold. Abstract, swirling patterns of soft pastel colors (pinks, oranges, yellows, purples) fill the background, creating a sense of movement and progression. Floating gently in the sky are small, delicate abstract shapes that suggest hearts or stars, made of shimmering light. The overall atmosphere is one of hopeful anticipation and blossoming love, visually representing the 'bright future' mentioned in the card's theme.
