    "backCover": "A simple and elegant artistic transformation design, continuing the theme from the front cover. On a soft, solid background of mint green, a single, large, shimmering iridescent ribbon gracefully swoops across the left and center of the card, trailing off towards the top left. The ribbon has the same magical, color-shifting quality as the one on the front cover, with hints of lavender and soft peach. The design is minimal and serene, providing a quiet, artistic conclusion. The bottom-right corner is left completely empty and undecorated.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and artistic transformation scene, flat 2D illustration. A charming cartoon boyfriend character (Jordan) is playfully presenting himself as a gift to his cartoon girlfriend character (Lao Lao). He is wrapped in a giant, shimmering, iridescent ribbon and bow, striking a funny, confident pose with a wide grin. Lao Lao is laughing with delight, her hands clasped in amusement. The scene is set against a dreamy, soft-focus background of swirling pastel colors like lavender, soft peach, and mint green, suggesting a magical transformation. The style is whimsical and painterly, with visible brushstrokes. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, flowing, and clearly readable handwritten cursive script.",
    "leftInterior": "An abstract, energetic explosion of a gift box, in a flat 2D artistic style. The illustration depicts a stylized, open gift box from a top-down perspective. Instead of a gift, a vibrant burst of swirling ribbons, confetti, and sparkling star shapes erupts from the center, rendered in the same iridescent palette of lavender, soft peach, and mint green from the front cover. The composition is dynamic and celebratory, full of movement and light. The painterly texture and whimsical energy connect it to the main theme, symbolizing the joyous surprise of the 'greatest gift'.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautifully designed message space on a soft peach background. The handwritten message is the centerpiece, written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. The text is framed by an artistic representation of the 'greatest gift' concept: a minimalist, glowing, golden outline of a human silhouette, as if drawn with light, surrounded by delicate, shimmering, iridescent ribbons that gently swirl around it and the message. The ribbons use the same lavender, soft peach, and mint green as the rest of the card, tying the whole design together. The overall effect is humorous, sophisticated, and artistic. Message text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a super expensive gift, but then I remembered having me as your boyfriend is the greatest gift of all. You're welcome! I hope you have a day that's as amazing as you are. Love, Jordan\"."
