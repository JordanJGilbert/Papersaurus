    "frontCover": "A funny, hand-drawn cartoon illustration of Lao Lao and Jordan as stylized characters, capturing their likeness from the reference photo. They are depicted riding a comically exaggerated roller coaster at Great America, with their hair flying wildly back and expressions of joyful terror. In the background, celebratory Fourth of July fireworks explode in the sky with vibrant, sketchy colors. Jordan is holding up a giant, half-eaten corndog, and Lao Lao is clutching a fluffy pink cotton candy, both looking slightly disheveled but blissfully happy. The entire scene is rendered in a warm, intimate, hand-drawn sketch style with visible pencil lines and artistic shading, giving it a personal, hand-crafted feel. Centered in a clear space amidst the chaos is the greeting \"Thank You\" written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The artwork is flat 2D, perfect for printing.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.\n\nMANDATORY CHARACTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS - ONLY INCLUDE WHAT IS ACTUALLY VISIBLE:\n- REPRESENT ONLY PEOPLE ACTUALLY IN THE PHOTOS: Create cartoon versions of ONLY the people who are actually shown in the reference photos. Do NOT add, create, or imagine any additional people not present in the reference images.\n- EXACT hair color, hair style, and hair length from each reference photo - only what is actually visible\n- PRECISE facial features for each person: eye color, eye shape, nose shape, face structure, skin tone - exactly as shown in the reference\n- ACCURATE clothing: replicate ONLY the EXACT clothing items, colors, patterns, and styles actually worn by each person in their reference photo - do not add or change any clothing items\n- ACCESSORIES ONLY IF VISIBLE: Include accessories (glasses, jewelry, hats, watches, bags, etc.) ONLY if they are actually visible on each person in the reference photo. DO NOT add glasses if they are not wearing glasses in the photo. DO NOT add jewelry if they are not wearing jewelry in the photo. DO NOT add any accessories that are not clearly visible in the reference image.\n- CORRECT body proportions and posture as shown for each person in their reference\n- FAITHFUL age representation and gender presentation for each individual - exactly as they appear\n- AUTHENTIC facial expressions and poses from the reference images, lean towards making the people look happier unless the user specifically asks for a different expression\n- GROUP COMPOSITION: If multiple people are actually shown in the photos, arrange them naturally together in a pleasing composition that fits the card's theme\n\nCRITICAL RESTRICTION: Do not add, remove, or modify any visual elements beyond what is actually visible in the reference photos. Only include people, clothing, and accessories that are clearly shown in the reference images.\n\nStudy every detail of the people actually in the reference image and recreate them as stylized cartoon characters while maintaining 100% accuracy to their distinctive visual features. The characters must be immediately recognizable as the same people from the reference photo. Pay special attention to clothing details and accessories that are actually visible, and unique personal style elements that make each person distinctive. Do not add or imagine any elements not present in the reference.\n\nThe cartoon style should be charming and artistic while preserving complete visual accuracy to the reference photo. Only represent people, clothing, and accessories that are actually visible in the reference images."
