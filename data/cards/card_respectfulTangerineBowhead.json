The background is a clean, creamy white, allowing the tree to be the hero, but with a subtle, pale sky-blue watercolor wash bleeding softly at the top, suggesting a clear, hopeful horizon. The text \"John Gilbert\" is rendered in a refined, hand-lettered serif font in a deep, warm grey, placed elegantly beneath the tree. Below his name, in a slightly smaller and simpler sans-serif font, are the words \"AI For Good | June 2025\". The overall effect is one of quiet strength, natural intelligence, and heartfelt appreciation, blending professionalism with the personal, handmade touch of a true keepsake.\n\n2.

The style is painterly, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly textured appearance, evoking a sense of digital painting with a watercolor-like finish. The background is a deep, rich navy blue, creating a strong contrast with the tree. The text \\\"John Gilbert\\\" is prominently displayed at the bottom in a clean, elegant serif font, colored a light, creamy white. Directly below this, in a slightly smaller sans-serif font, are the words \\\"AI For Good\\\". Below that, in an even smaller, subtly spaced font, is \\\"JUNE 2025 | JUNE 2025\\\". The overall mood is sophisticated, inspiring, and subtly magical.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card featuring a minimalist, elegant design. The deep navy blue background from the front cover continues. In the upper left quadrant, a subtle, abstract swirl of teal and gold watercolor-like texture echoes the colors of the tree canopy from the front. This textured element is soft and blended, providing a gentle visual connection. The central and right portions of the card, including the bottom right 1-inch square area, are intentionally left blank and clear to accommodate a QR code.

This branch is adorned with small, scattered clusters of teal and gold watercolor-like textures, similar to the foliage on the front but much more subtle. The visual focus is on a beautifully rendered, large quote that reads: \\\"Thank you for attending, thank you for helping prosper thought.\\\" This quote is written in an elegant, flowing cursive script, in a creamy white color that stands out against the dark background. The script is legible, with a natural, artistic flow.

Subtle, thin, glowing neon green grid lines are visible in the lower left portion of the background, extending diagonally upwards and to the right.

The background is a deep, dark navy blue, reminiscent of a starry night sky, with subtle speckles of lighter blue and faint glow effects. Emerging from the bottom center is the delicate, dark silhouette of a bare tree, its branches reaching upwards and outwards. Scattered throughout the upper half of the image, seemingly floating in the air like abstract thoughts or ideas, are geometric shapes: teal blue triangles, golden yellow triangles, and muted pink circles. Some of these shapes have a subtle gradient, giving them a soft, luminous quality. Smaller, lighter dots of varying colors are interspersed, mimicking distant stars. Prominently displayed in the lower half of the image, in a warm, golden yellow sans-serif font, is the quote: \"The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\" The text is centered and positioned to allow ample negative space, maintaining a clean and impactful presentation. The overall aesthetic is sophisticated, inspirational, and subtly cosmic, evoking a sense of wonder and intellectual expansion.",

The text is positioned in the center-left of the card, with ample negative space for readability. The background is a deep, rich navy blue, subtly textured to resemble a night sky or dark, sophisticated fabric. Framing the right side of the card is an abstract geometric design in shimmering gold. This design consists of interconnected thin lines and small diamond shapes, some of which are illuminated with a soft, warm glow, creating a sense of delicate constellation or a stylized network of ideas. The overall aesthetic is modern, professional, and subtly luxurious, with the gold accents providing an inspirational and uplifting feel."
