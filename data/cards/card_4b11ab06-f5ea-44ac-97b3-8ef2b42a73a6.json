    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design. The background is a full-bleed, soft, light-colored watercolor wash with a subtle paper texture, matching the front cover. A few loose Mahjong tiles and a small stack of stylized watercolor cash are artistically placed in the upper-left corner, appearing as if they've gently fallen there. The style is a flat 2D illustration with artistic brushstrokes and organic paint bleeds. The overall feeling is serene and minimal. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1-inch square, is left completely blank and free of any decoration to allow for QR code placement.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and dynamic watercolor scene of Lao Lao as a cartoon character, inspired by the reference photo. She is sitting majestically on a throne made of stacked Mahjong tiles, wearing a playful paper crown slightly askew. In one hand, she's expertly holding a bubble tea, and in the other, she's fanning herself with a giant wad of cash. At her feet, a small, adoring cartoon version of Jordan, also inspired by the reference photo, is presenting her with a beautifully wrapped gift. The background is a soft, light-colored watercolor wash with gentle paint splatters and organic bleeds, suggesting a festive and chaotic celebration. Centered in the middle of the card, written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday\". The entire image is a flat 2D illustration, full of artistic brushstrokes and a subtle paper texture, capturing a funny, lighthearted moment.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image. You MUST create cartoon/illustrated characters that accurately represent ONLY the people who are actually visible in this reference photo with high fidelity to their appearance.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, full-bleed abstract watercolor pattern that complements the front cover. The design features a dynamic and playful arrangement of scattered Mahjong tiles, cascading across the page from the top-left towards the bottom-right. The background is the same soft, light-colored watercolor wash with gentle splatters and a subtle paper texture. The tiles are painted in a flat 2D illustrative style with visible brushstrokes and soft, flowing colors, creating a sense of festive, lighthearted movement without any characters.",
    "rightInterior": "A decorative watercolor illustration featuring the message. The background is a soft, light-colored watercolor wash that matches the other card panels. Artistic flourishes of watercolor paint, reminiscent of festive confetti, are scattered delicately in the corners, leaving the center clear. Integrated beautifully into the artwork is the text, written in a flowing, easily readable handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a huge, expensive gift, but then I remembered my love and charm are priceless (and free). You're welcome! Hope you have the best day.\n\nLove,\nJordan\". The style is flat 2D with artistic brush strokes and a subtle paper texture. The text and key elements are kept away from all edges for safe printing."
