    "frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A dreamy, whimsical beach scene in a fantasy art style with magical, ethereal elements. The beach has soft, pastel pink sand and the ocean is a shimmering, iridescent turquoise with gentle, glowing waves. In the sky, fluffy, cotton-candy-like clouds in shades of lavender and peach float by, and faint, magical sparkles are scattered throughout the air.\n\nIn the center of this magical beach, the couple from the reference photo is illustrated in a cute, cartoon style. Lao Lao (person on the left) is sitting cross-legged on a giant, iridescent tapioca pearl, holding a comically oversized boba tea cup that is almost as big as she is. She's laughing joyfully as she tries to sip from the huge straw. Jordan (person on the right) stands beside her, also laughing, playfully trying to push the giant boba cup over with one hand while holding another, normal-sized boba tea in his other hand. Lao Lao wears her light blue sweatshirt from the photo, and Jordan wears his tan hoodie.\n\nThe entire scene is lighthearted and humorous, emphasizing the fantasy scale of the boba. The color palette is bright, soft, and magical.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating in a clear area of the sky, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite Lao Lao\" in a beautiful, readable, glowing white handwritten cursive script.",
    "backCover": "Minimalist flat 2D illustration for the back of a greeting card. A simple, clean background using the soft pastel color palette from the front cover, like a gentle gradient of lavender into soft peach. In the upper-left quadrant, a small, elegant cluster of iridescent, glowing bubbles floats gently, reminiscent of tapioca pearls, catching the light with a subtle shimmer. The rest of the design is very sparse, with a faint, magical sparkle effect scattered lightly across the top half only. The bottom half, especially the bottom-right corner, is left completely clear and undecorated. The overall aesthetic is clean, dreamy, and magical, in a whimsical fantasy anime style.",
    "leftInterior": "Flat 2D illustration for the left interior panel of a greeting card, in a dreamy fantasy anime style. A full-bleed background depicting the edge of a magical beach scene. On the left side, soft, pastel pink sand meets a shimmering, iridescent turquoise ocean with gentle, glowing waves. A few whimsical, pastel-colored seashells and starfish are scattered sparsely along the shoreline. Fluffy, cotton-candy-like clouds in shades of lavender and peach float in the sky above. Faint, magical sparkles are scattered throughout the air, creating a soft, enchanting, and magical atmosphere. The design is purely decorative and environmental, with no figures or text, serving as a beautiful, subtle continuation of the front cover's theme.",
    "rightInterior": "Flat 2D illustration for the right interior panel of a greeting card, designed to hold a written message. A full-bleed background with a very soft, ethereal gradient of pale peach and lavender. The design features minimal, elegant corner decorations. In the top-left and bottom-right corners, there are small, delicate arrangements of glowing, magical sparkles and a few tiny, iridescent bubbles, framing the central area. The center of the panel is intentionally left open and clear with a very light, almost white, soft glow, creating an elegant and defined space for text. The style is dreamy fantasy anime, focusing on a magical and light atmosphere while prioritizing readability for a message.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my wonderful Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! You know, I was going to get you a gift that was as amazing as your long legs, but I couldn't find a box that big. I guess you'll just have to settle for all my love instead.\n\nForever yours,\nJordan\""
