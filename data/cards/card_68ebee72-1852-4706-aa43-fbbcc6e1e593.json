    "frontCover": "A watercolor painting of a charming, slightly frazzled cartoon squirrel wearing a tiny party hat, struggling to balance a giant, wobbly stack of birthday presents. One gift is precariously teetering on its head. The squirrel has a look of comical determination. The background is a soft wash of light blue and yellow, with artistic paint splatters and visible paper texture. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, John!\". The entire scene is flat 2D, with soft, flowing colors, organic paint bleeds, and visible brush strokes, evoking a lighthearted and humorous feel.",
    "backCover": "A serene, minimalist watercolor painting. The background is a full-bleed soft wash of light blue and yellow, identical to the front cover, with visible paper texture and subtle, artistic paint splatters. In the top-left corner, a single, small, beautifully wrapped gift box is depicted, painted in the same whimsical style as the presents on the front, with a tiny, elegant ribbon. The rest of the card is a tranquil blend of soft colors with organic paint bleeds. The bottom-right corner, approximately a 1-inch square, is left completely clear and undecorated, maintaining the soft background texture for QR code placement. There are no people or characters.",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful, full-bleed abstract watercolor design that complements the front cover. The artwork consists of a playful pattern of colorful, whimsical birthday ribbons and confetti gently cascading across the page from the top-left to the bottom-right. The ribbons are painted with soft, flowing strokes in shades of yellow, blue, and hints of celebratory colors, creating a sense of movement and joy. The background maintains the soft wash of light blue and yellow with visible paper texture and organic paint bleeds, ensuring visual continuity. The design is purely decorative, with no people or characters, creating a lighthearted and artistic interior.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor painting with decorative elements framing a heartfelt message. The background is a soft, full-bleed wash of light blue and yellow with visible paper texture and subtle paint splatters, matching the overall card style. Delicate, whimsical watercolor illustrations of falling confetti and swirling ribbons, similar to the left interior, gently frame the central area from the top-left and bottom-right corners, enhancing the celebratory feel without overwhelming the space. In the center, positioned for optimal readability away from the top and bottom edges, the following message is written in a beautiful, elegant, and exceptionally clear handwritten cursive script with high contrast against the light background: \"Happy Birthday John! Hope your special day is filled with joy, laughter, and all your favorite things. Wishing you an amazing year ahead!\" The artwork is purely decorative and contains no people or characters."
