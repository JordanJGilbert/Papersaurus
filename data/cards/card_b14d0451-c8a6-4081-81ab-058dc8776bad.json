    "backCover": "A simple, yet elegant design in a dreamy fantasy anime style. On the left and top sides of the card, a whimsical garland of glowing, pastel-colored star-shaped confetti and iridescent bubbles cascades gently downwards against a soft, twilight-colored background. One oversized, beautifully detailed bubble in the center subtly reflects the enchanted forest from the front cover. The design is minimal and serene, creating a peaceful resolution. The bottom-right corner area is left completely blank and undecorated. Flat 2D artwork, full-bleed.",

A shower of sparkling pixie dust and tiny, whimsical star-shaped confetti falls around them. The background is a soft-focus enchanted woodland at twilight, with gentle light filtering through a canopy of glowing trees. In the center, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, flowing handwritten cursive script in a shimmering gold color.

The design elements are concentrated in the corners, leaving a clear, luminous area in the center for the message. In the center, the message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script with a dark, shimmering ink: 'Happy Birthday to our favorite birthday twins, Vivi and Audrey!
