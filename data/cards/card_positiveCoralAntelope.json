    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration for a greeting card front cover. Lao Lao (person on the left in the reference photo) is depicted as a regal, slightly smug queen, lounging playfully on an oversized, ornate golden throne. She wears a magnificent royal gown and a comically large crown perched slightly askew on her head. With a relaxed expression, she leans back into plush velvet cushions. Beside her throne, Jordan (person on the right in the reference photo) is portrayed as a loyal and slightly flustered royal guard. He is dressed in a funny, ill-fitting guard uniform with a big, fuzzy hat. He is kneeling on one knee, diligently feeding a single grape to Queen Lao Lao, who has her mouth open ready to receive it. In his other hand, he holds a gigantic, cartoonish tropical leaf, fanning her dramatically. The scene is set in a whimsical throne room with light-colored stone walls and soft shadows. The entire illustration is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible brush strokes and color washes in pastel tones.\n\nIn the center of the card, below the main illustration, the text \"Happy Birthday to my Queen\" is written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script.",
    "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant watercolor design for a greeting card back cover. A single, stylized golden crown logo, simple and modern, is centered in the upper half of the frame. The background is a clean, off-white with a subtle paper texture. The entire illustration is rendered in a soft watercolor style with delicate, light pastel color washes around the edges, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear. Flat 2D artwork.",
    "leftInterior": "A subtle and decorative watercolor illustration for the left interior of a greeting card. A beautiful, ornate pattern of interlocking golden filigree and soft pastel floral elements cascades gracefully down the left side, covering about 40% of the panel. The design is abstract and elegant, echoing a regal aesthetic without any central figures. The background is a soft, textured off-white. Rendered in a watercolor painting style with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. Flat 2D artwork.",
    "rightInterior": "A minimal watercolor decoration for the right interior of a greeting card, designed to leave ample space for a handwritten message. A simple, elegant golden filigree border adorns the top and bottom edges of the panel. The design is delicate and unobtrusive, taking up no more than 20% of the space. The large central area is a clean, off-white with a subtle paper texture, perfect for writing. Rendered in a watercolor painting style with soft, transparent washes of gold and pastel tones. Flat 2D artwork.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my wonderful Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to get you a lifetime supply of boba, but then I realized having me is basically the same thing: sweet, brings you joy, and occasionally full of surprises. Plus, I'm way better at cuddling than a plastic cup.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""
