    "backCover": "Back cover design for a humorous birthday greeting card with a smart, minimalist aesthetic. The style is flat 2D vector art with clean, bold lines and a limited, desaturated color palette. The background is a very light, off-white or pale beige. Centered on the back cover, and positioned slightly to the left to avoid potential cropping of a QR code in the bottom right corner, is a single, stylized illustration of a crumpled piece of paper. This crumpled paper is rendered with thick, dark grey outlines that define its irregular, crinkled shape. The interior of the shape is filled with a flat, light grey color, with subtle darker grey shading to give a hint of dimensionality and texture to the folds. The overall impression is a simple, graphic representation of discarded writing, subtly alluding to the card's message about not writing a long message. The design is intentionally sparse, providing a clean and understated conclusion to the card's visual narrative, and leaving ample space for a QR code or other branding elements in the lower right quadrant. There is no text present on the back cover.",

Each ball has a slightly irregular, organic shape, suggesting multiple layers of paper. The placement of the crumpled paper balls is uniform, creating a grid-like pattern across the entire surface of the page. There is no text or additional imagery, emphasizing the playful, slightly chaotic yet simple visual theme. The overall effect is clean, modern, and subtly witty, hinting at the message without explicitly stating it.
