    "frontCover": "**Front Cover Prompt:**\n\nA humorous and romantic 2D flat illustration for a greeting card front. Two stylized cartoon characters, Jordan and Lao Lao, are depicted at an amusement park, created from the provided reference photo. Jordan has a comically terrified expression, gripping the safety bar of a roller coaster cart with white knuckles. Lao Lao is next to him, laughing joyfully with her hands in the air, wind blowing through her hair. In the background, whimsical fireworks, stylized to look like bursting dandelions or star-shaped flowers, explode in the night sky, reminiscent of the Fourth of July. The roller coaster track is made of twisting vines and leafy branches, and the cart is adorned with detailed botanical illustrations of roses and eucalyptus leaves. Framing the entire scene is a lush, elegant border of intertwined ferns, passionflowers, and hibiscus, rendered in a soft, organic botanical style. In the center of the card, written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Thank you for the wild ride\". The overall aesthetic is a playful and unique blend of amusement park chaos and serene botanical beauty.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.
