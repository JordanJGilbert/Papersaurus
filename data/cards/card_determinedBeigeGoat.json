    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a vibrant, cartoonish digital art style. The color palette is bright and cheerful, dominated by a bold sky blue background, a large glass filled with orange-colored liquid that's splashing outwards, and colorful boba pearls. At the top of the card, two joyful children, a boy with dark curly hair and a girl with a ponytail, are jumping with their arms raised in excitement. The boy is wearing a red t-shirt and blue jeans, and the girl is wearing a pink t-shirt and teal pants. Both have wide smiles and closed eyes. The glass of orange liquid is prominent in the foreground, overflowing with a dynamic splash. Inside the glass, the text \"Happy Birthday, Darien!\" is written in a thick, dark brown, playful font with a slight shadow. Below the text, numerous boba pearls of various colors (purple, green, orange, blue, brown, yellow, pink, teal) are visible within the liquid. A thick, brown boba straw extends from the top of the glass, angled towards the right. A couple of stylized white clouds are present in the upper corners against the blue sky. The overall mood is extremely happy, celebratory, and energetic.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a simple, flat illustration style. The background is a light cream color with a subtle paper texture. Centered in the lower half of the card is a single, large, dark brown boba pearl depicted as a cute character. It has a wide, happy smile with its mouth open, revealing a bright red tongue and white teeth. Above its smiling face are two curved black lines representing closed, joyful eyes. The boba character has two small, stubby black arms; its left arm is raised, holding a small, geometric object that resembles a party streamer or confetti. This object is a triangle shape, divided into three sections with colors: dark blue on the left, bright yellow in the middle, and a lighter blue on the right. A soft, purple shadow is cast beneath the boba pearl, giving it a slight sense of depth. There is ample negative space around the character, creating a clean and uncluttered aesthetic. There is no visible text or QR code placement. This design serves as a sweet and playful concluding visual to the card's theme.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a whimsical, bubbly aesthetic, featuring a vibrant, warm color palette dominated by oranges and yellows. The artwork depicts numerous glossy, dark brown boba pearls scattered throughout a fluid, liquid-like background with visible wavy textures and a shimmering, underwater or syrupy feel. Several boba pearls are anthropomorphized with charming, simple facial expressions: one wears oversized, teal-colored goggles, another floats blissfully on a yellow inner tube, and a few others have contented, closed-eye smiles. Tiny, translucent bubbles are interspersed among the boba pearls, adding to the effervescent and playful atmosphere. Golden sunbeams or light rays penetrate from the top of the image, creating a radiant and inviting glow. Two stylized yellow starbursts are subtly placed amongst the pearls. The overall composition is dense and dynamic, with the pearls arranged at various depths and angles, creating a sense of immersion. The artistic style is illustrative and painterly, with visible brushstrokes and soft gradients, evoking a cozy and cheerful mood. There is no visible text or typography on this interior page.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a stylized illustration of a tall glass of boba tea. The glass has a thick, warm orange border, and the interior is a lighter, peachy orange with a subtle textured paper look. Within the glass, the main message area is defined by delicate, swirling white decorative flourishes that emanate from the sides, creating a gentle frame that surrounds the text. Small white circles, resembling bubbles, are scattered around the top and sides of the glass, adding a light, effervescent feel. Numerous dark brown circles, representing boba pearls, are clustered at the bottom and scattered throughout the upper part of the glass, some appearing to float near the surface. The typography for the printed text, \"Happy birthday, Darien!\" and \"Wishing you the best year, Laotong\", is a friendly, handwritten-style script in a darker orange hue. The text is centered, with ample negative space between lines to accommodate handwritten messages. The design balances a playful, thematic illustration with generous clear space for personalization."
