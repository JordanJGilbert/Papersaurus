    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 ratio. The artwork features a cute, stylized cartoon robot with bright blue glowing eyes and a friendly expression, waving with one hand. The robot is entangled in a large, colorful mess of wires and cables in vibrant hues of red, orange, yellow, green, and blue, with various connector types visible at the ends. The background is a deep, solid navy blue. Above the robot, the word \"Oops...\" is written in a playful, bright pink, slightly slanted cursive font. Small, yellow starbursts or sparks are scattered around the robot, adding a touch of playful chaos. The overall style is flat 2D illustration with bold outlines and a slightly retro feel, exuding a quirky and lighthearted tone, fitting for an apology. The text \"Oops...\" is positioned in the upper central area, safely away from the top edge.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a flat 2D illustration style. The background is a solid, deep indigo blue. In the center of the composition, a stylized, bright yellow electrical plug is connected to a blue electrical outlet. A thick, vibrant orange cord extends from the plug and curves downwards, forming a smooth, simplified line. At the end of the cord, a stylized, simple white hand is shown giving a thumbs-up gesture. Three small, dashed white lines emanate from the thumb, suggesting a positive affirmation or success. The overall design is clean, minimalist, and uses bold, flat colors with thick black outlines. There is no text or specific branding, and the composition is centered with plenty of negative space. The design evokes a sense of completion, connection, and approval, fitting a theme of \"AI for good was awesome\" and a \"thumbs up\" outcome. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a \"Friendly A.I. Brain\" theme, presented in a flat, 2D illustrative style with a bold and quirky aesthetic. The background is a deep navy blue, mimicking the overall card's color palette. Dominating the center is a large, rounded square, bright yellow, depicting a friendly AI core with simple, smiling eyes and a curved smile. Extending from this central unit are various stylized lines and shapes representing connections and functions, rendered in vibrant pink and electric blue. To the upper left, a yellow, cloud-shaped element labeled \"GOOD IDEAS\" is connected via pink lines. To the upper right, a blue rectangular box with four blue play-arrow symbols inside is labeled \"CAT VIDEO STORAGE,\" also connected by pink lines. Below this, a blue circular icon with a yellow center, labeled \"CALENDAR SYNC,\" is similarly connected. Further down on the right, a tall blue rectangular container, labeled \"QUANTUM COFFEE MAKER,\" is depicted with steaming lines and a blue coffee cup beneath it, all connected by the network of pink lines. In the lower left, a pink electrical plug with yellow lightning bolts emanating from it is shown, hinting at power or a potential glitch, also integrated into the network. The overall composition is reminiscent of a circuit diagram, but with playful and abstract elements that convey a sense of quirky functionality and personality. The entire illustration is clean, graphic, and uses a limited but high-contrast color palette, creating a visually engaging and unconventional design.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a vintage computer monitor theme. The monitor displays a dark navy blue screen with a cream-colored bezel. A stylized, light teal robotic arm with a two-fingered gripper is shown extending from the left side of the screen, holding a rectangular, coral-colored card. On this coral card, handwritten in a flowing, slightly whimsical cursive script, is the message: \"sorry for the mixup on the pitch scheduling - craig\". The monitor screen itself is filled with a pixelated-style graphic of scattered square blocks in shades of coral, teal, and mustard yellow, with a denser \"brick-like\" pattern of these same colors forming a lower section of the screen. The overall aesthetic is flat, 2D, and incorporates a retro, slightly quirky technological vibe with a limited, bold color palette."
