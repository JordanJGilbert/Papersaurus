The background is a soft gradient from yellow at the top to light blue at the bottom, with scattered fluffy white clouds. Centered prominently is a large, outlined heart shape in a warm orange hue. Inside the heart, in an elegant, flowing handwritten cursive script, is the text \\\"Pensando en ti, Tia Chivis\\\". Positioned on the left side, within the lower half of the card, is a stylized cartoon hummingbird depicted in vibrant green, playing a ukulele. On the right side, mirroring the hummingbird's position, is another stylized cartoon hummingbird, also in green, wearing a brown cowboy hat and holding a tin can to its beak, as if speaking through a homemade telephone. Connecting these two hummingbirds is a stylized, playful orange string, forming loops. Below the hummingbirds, the map of Mexico, specifically highlighting the area of Silao, is shown in a bright green watercolor wash on the left. On the right, the United States is depicted in a blue watercolor wash. The overall mood is lighthearted, humorous, and whimsical, with soft, blended colors and visible brushstrokes characteristic of watercolor art. The text is clear and readable, with safe margins from the edges.\",\n  \"backCover\": \"Back cover of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, continuing the charming watercolor painting style.

The focus is on serene, artistic decoration with no text or people. A small, approximate 1-inch square area in the bottom right corner is completely clear and undecorated, reserved for a QR code. The artistic elements are minimal and peaceful, creating a sense of gentle conclusion.\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"Left interior of a greeting card with a 9:16 aspect ratio, rendered in a consistent charming watercolor painting style.

The hummingbird on the left, in vibrant green, is shown in profile, looking towards the right, with its wings outstretched and body angled slightly downwards. It appears to be chirping or singing with a joyful expression. The hummingbird on the right, also in green, is facing the left, with its wings also spread. It is holding a delicate, unfinished Lego orchid piece in its beak, looking slightly proud and accomplished.

The background features a soft, blended wash of pale yellow and sky blue, creating a serene and airy atmosphere.

At the end of the twine, on the left side of the image, are two small, stylized feathers, one in a soft blue transitioning to yellow, and the other a solid blue, painted with subtle brushstrokes that suggest movement and lightness. The overall composition is sparse, with the focal elements of the twine and feathers placed artfully against the textured watercolor paper. There is no text or explicit design for a QR code area, allowing for maximum creative interpretation and a sense of peaceful, open resolution to the card's visual narrative.

    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a whimsical watercolor illustration of an orchid constructed from building blocks. The orchid, rendered in vibrant teal, pink, and orange hues, is the focal point, dominating the right side of the page. Delicate, pale green vines with subtle watercolor speckles in yellow and blue arch gracefully from the upper left corner, framing the open space. Below the orchid, the text \"Con cariÃ±o, Fam Hdez Ag\" is written in an elegant, flowing black cursive script. Further down, a congratulatory message in the same cursive script reads \"Â¡Felicidades por terminar tu orquÃ­dea de bloques!\". Below this, another line of cursive text states \"Con cariÃ±o, por terminar tu orquÃ­dea\" leading to a clear blank space indicated for a handwritten message, also in a similar cursive style. The background is a soft, creamy off-white with subtle watercolor paper texture and faint paint splatters, enhancing the artistic feel. The overall impression is lighthearted and celebratory, with a clear division between the decorative floral elements and the ample writing space."
