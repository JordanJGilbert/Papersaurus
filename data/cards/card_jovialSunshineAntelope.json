    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a vibrant, retro-futuristic, 80s synthwave aesthetic. The art style is a clean, low-poly digital illustration with bold outlines and a somewhat blocky, pixelated feel. The dominant color palette features deep purples, electric blues, hot pinks, and bright oranges, creating a neon-infused, dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nThe main subjects are two stylized, blocky cartoon characters, joyfully riding on the back of a large, orange, low-poly tabby cat. Both characters are depicted with wide smiles and raised fists in celebration. The character on the left wears a green t-shirt and dark pants, while the character on the right wears an orange t-shirt and glasses. The cat has bright yellow eyes and an open mouth.\n\nSuperimposed in the foreground, prominently displayed, is the text \"happy birthday\" in a bold, metallic, chrome-like font with a glossy, gradient fill that shifts from blue to pink and purple, reflecting the neon lighting. The text has a slight 3D effect and is outlined in black.\n\nThe background is a surreal landscape composed of a grid pattern receding into the distance, characteristic of early computer graphics and synthwave imagery. This grid is illuminated with neon blue lines. Silhouetted against the vibrant sky are stylized pink palm trees. Scattered throughout the image are floating elements: several Roman bust sculptures in light pink, various emojis (smiley faces, thumbs up), and colorful, rectangular confetti pieces.\n\nThe overall mood is energetic, celebratory, fun, and slightly quirky, evoking a sense of playful nostalgia. The composition is dynamic, with the subjects positioned in the mid-ground, drawing the viewer's eye towards the celebratory text and the retro-futuristic environment.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a humorous greeting card with a soft, dreamy aesthetic. The scene depicts a stylized beach at sunset or sunrise, with a sandy foreground and a gradient sky transitioning from pale pink to soft purple. Dominating the upper left portion of the image is a neon outline of a palm tree, glowing with a bright white light. In the sandy foreground, slightly to the left of center and lower down, is a clear impression of a dog's paw print, rendered in a warm, golden-orange color. The sandy texture is finely detailed, with subtle lines suggesting a very smooth, perhaps compressed surface. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with soft pastels and glowing highlights. The composition uses negative space effectively, with the majority of the lower and right portions of the card left open for text, potentially a company logo or QR code, though none are explicitly shown in this image. The design provides a visual continuation of a whimsical theme, perhaps relating to a pet or a vacation, and offers a gentle, calming closure to the visual story of the card.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a greeting card with a vibrant, energetic, retro-futuristic graphic design. The background is a deep, dark navy blue, reminiscent of a night sky or outer space. Dominating the scene are sharp, angular \"lightning bolt\" shapes in bright magenta and electric blue, radiating outwards from various points. These shapes vary in size and intensity, creating a dynamic sense of motion and explosion. Interspersed among the lightning bolts are clusters of pixelated or \"glitched\" squares in pink and cyan, adding a digital, retro-gaming aesthetic. Scattered throughout the composition are three smooth, gradient spheres, transitioning from pink to purple to blue, appearing to float in the cosmic background. Additionally, several shaded pyramids in complementary colors (blue, pink, purple) are strategically placed, contributing to the geometric, almost abstract feel. A distinctive visual element is the wavy, distorted checkered pattern, rendered in alternating squares of cyan and magenta, which creates a sense of depth and warping space, reminiscent of early computer graphics or a psychedelic warp effect. The overall color palette is a high-contrast, neon-inspired combination of deep blues, purples, vibrant pinks, and bright cyans, creating a visually striking and harmonious, yet chaotic, composition. The layout is asymmetrical and maximalist, filling the entire page with these explosive graphic elements, conveying excitement and a bold, attention-grabbing visual. There is no visible text or typography. The style evokes 1980s arcade games, synthwave aesthetics, and abstract expressionism with a digital twist, fitting perfectly for a \"funny card for the homie\" by being over-the-top and visually stimulating.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a dark purple, retro-futuristic aesthetic. The background is a black void with a subtle grid pattern in vibrant purple that recedes into the distance. Scattered across the background are small, white, glowing stars. Framing the top of the page, on both the left and right sides, are digital cross-stitch style floral vines in neon pink and electric blue. These vines are intricate, with small, pixelated flowers and leaves. The printed text, in a flowing, neon pink script font, reads \"Craig, happy birthday to the only one who matches my chaotic energy. No cap, you're the main character. Let's get this bread and celebrate you being old AF. Slay, - Jordan\". The space for handwritten messages is centrally located, with the printed text strategically placed to allow ample room. Positioned at the bottom, on either side of the central text block, are detailed busts of classical sculptures, rendered in a vibrant, glowing teal and purple palette, with a distinct vaporwave or synthwave style. These sculptures are lit with neon-like highlights."
