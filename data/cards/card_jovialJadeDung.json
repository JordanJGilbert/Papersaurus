  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing birthday greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\nðŸŽ¨ CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clichÃ© designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"hi\"\nStyle: âœ¨ Smart Style\nTone: ðŸ˜„ Funny - humorous and lighthearted\nTo: hi\nFrom: bye \nMessage: \"hi,\nWell, this is a bit awkward. I guess this is goodbye to your youth! Just kidding... mostly. Hope you have a day that's as awesome as you are.\n\nHappy Birthday!\nbye\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front â†’ interior â†’ back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages.

Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a charming and whimsical storybook illustration style, reminiscent of classic children's literature. The scene features two adorable, fuzzy animal charactersâ€”perhaps a friendly bear (\"bye\") shyly offering a single, brightly-colored wildflower to a curious little rabbit (\"hi\"). The artwork is rendered in soft, warm-toned colored pencils and a gentle watercolor wash, giving it a nostalgic and tender feel.

    "frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card with a playful and retro-futuristic cartoon style. The background is a solid, soft peachy-pink color. Dominating the center of the image is a stylized, silver robot with large, bright blue circular eyes that have a subtle glow. The robot has a blocky torso with a gold rectangular plate on the front displaying \"BYE-BOT 3000\" in a bold, simple, sans-serif font. It has articulated arms and legs, with the left arm raised slightly and the right arm extended, palm open. Hovering above the right palm is a pixelated red heart, outlined in black, with small, jagged lines emanating from it, suggesting a digital signal or \"spark.\" Above the robot's head, the word \"hi!\" is written in large, bubbly, light blue letters with a subtle shiny texture, positioned off-center towards the top left. The overall mood is cheerful and quirky, with a clean, flat illustration style and bold outlines.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a greeting card with a minimalist, retro pixel art aesthetic. The background is a soft, pale pink, transitioning to a slightly lighter shade towards the top. Centered in the lower half of the image is a classic red, pixelated heart icon, with visible square pixels forming its shape. Below the heart, in a simple, sans-serif font, is the text \"BYE-BOT 3000\". The overall composition is clean and understated, with ample negative space. There is no visible space reserved for a QR code. The style is flat 2D artwork.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday greeting card, designed in a playful and technical \"blueprint\" style with a humorous tone. The background is a grid-like pattern reminiscent of a blueprint, in a light blue hue. The primary visual is a whimsical, anthropomorphic robot character, outlined in crisp white, as if it were a schematic diagram. This robot has a boxy body, a cubical head with two simple dot eyes and a curved line for a mouth, and segmented arms and legs. Various technical-sounding labels are humorously attached to the robot via dashed lines, such as \"AWKWARD GESTURE MOTOR,\" \"OVERTHINKING PROCESSOR,\" \"SARCASM MODULE (beta),\" and \"GENUINE AFFECTION CORE.\" Small, playful graphical elements like squiggly lines, question marks, and a stylized screw add to the technical and quirky aesthetic. The overall composition is clean, schematic, and emphasizes the humorous labeling of the robot's parts to convey a lighthearted and self-aware personality. The style is flat 2D artwork, suitable for printing, with a full-bleed background.",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a greeting card designed for message space with a minimalist, tech-inspired aesthetic. The background is a soft, muted pink. The left side of the page features the birthday message \"hi, Well, this is a bit awkward. I guess this is goodbye to your youth! Just kidding... mostly. Hope you have a day that's as awesome as you are. Happy Birthday! bye\" in a simple, sans-serif font, with generous line spacing to accommodate handwritten additions. The right side of the page is filled with columns of binary code (0s and 1s) in alternating colors of soft blue, purple, and a peachy-orange. Interspersed within the binary code are small, stylized icons: two small orange hearts, and a smiley face made of binary code. The overall impression is clean, modern, and subtly playful, with the binary code acting as a unique decorative element that aligns with a \"smart style\" and humorous tone. The text is positioned to allow ample space for a handwritten message, adhering to safe printing margins. The typography is clear and readable against the light background. There are no borders or frames, emphasizing the full-bleed nature of the design. The color palette is limited to the background pink and the binary code colors, creating a cohesive and visually appealing spread."
