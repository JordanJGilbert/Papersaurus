  "prompt": "Create 4 prompts for a cohesive, chronologically flowing birthday greeting card that tells a visual story (9:16 ratio):\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 CREATIVITY MANDATE: Be genuinely creative, unique, and innovative! Avoid generic or clich\u00e9 designs. Think outside the box, surprise with unexpected elements, use bold artistic choices, and create something truly memorable and special. Push creative boundaries while staying appropriate for the card type and tone.\n\nTheme: \"hi\"\nStyle: \u2728 Smart Style\nTone: \ud83d\ude04 Funny - humorous and lighthearted\nTo: hi\nFrom: bye \nMessage: \"hi,\nWell, this is a bit awkward. I guess this is goodbye to your youth! Just kidding... mostly. Hope you have a day that's as awesome as you are.\n\nHappy Birthday!\nbye\"\n\n\n\nCRITICAL: Create a cohesive visual narrative that flows chronologically through the card experience:\n1. FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages. If the user requests something potentially inappropriate, redirect to positive, wholesome alternatives that capture their intent in a family-friendly way\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"birthday\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image).

Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a charming and whimsical storybook illustration style, reminiscent of classic children's literature. The scene features two adorable, fuzzy animal characters\u2014perhaps a friendly bear (\"bye\") shyly offering a single, brightly-colored wildflower to a curious little rabbit (\"hi\"). The artwork is rendered in soft, warm-toned colored pencils and a gentle watercolor wash, giving it a nostalgic and tender feel. The characters have sweet, expressive faces, and the background is a simple, idyllic meadow with blades of grass and a few floating dandelion seeds, creating a moment that is pure, innocent, and full of heartfelt affection.\n\n2.
