    "frontCover": "A birthday greeting card front cover featuring a funny cartoon illustration in a botanical style. In the center, a young East Asian woman with long dark straight hair and thin-rimmed glasses (Lao Lao, from reference photo), smiling happily, is depicted as a queen sitting on an ornate golden throne. She is wearing a royal gown inspired by her light blue sweatshirt and is playfully bonking a jester with her scepter. The jester is a young Southeast Asian man with short black messy hair and a broad, joyful smile (Jordan, from reference photo), kneeling beside the throne and wearing a jester's hat and a costume inspired by his tan hoodie and maroon pants. A decorative banner above them reads \"Another Year of Ruling\". In the safe center area, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The entire scene is framed by an elegant arrangement of detailed botanical elements: lush green leaves, delicate flowers like peonies and daisies, and soft organic vines, all in a flat 2D art style suitable for printing. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0 --sref https://s.mj.run/Jv9QUp866yk --cref https://s.mj.run/Jv9QUp866yk --cw 100 --seed 7c90b4b1\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style",
    "backCover": "A minimalist botanical illustration for a greeting card back cover. A single elegant sprig with delicate green leaves and a small, soft pink peony bud extends from the top left corner, reaching towards the center. The background is a clean, solid off-white. The overall design is very simple, clean, and occupies about 20% of the space, leaving the bottom right corner completely empty. Flat 2D art style, soft organic lines. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0",
    "leftInterior": "A beautiful botanical illustration for the left interior of a greeting card. An elegant, asymmetrical arrangement of lush green leaves, soft pink peonies, and small white daisies frames the left and top edges of the panel. The design is richer than the back cover but still feels light and airy, occupying about 40% of the space. The background is a solid off-white, and the overall style is flat 2D art with soft organic shapes. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0",
    "rightInterior": "A minimal botanical design for the right interior of a greeting card, intended to frame a message. A simple, elegant corner decoration in the bottom right features a few delicate green leaves and a single small, unopened peony bud. The composition is sparse, occupying less than 20% of the total area, leaving the majority of the panel as a clean, solid off-white space for handwritten text. Flat 2D art style, soft organic lines. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my Queen Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! This card is pretty accurate, but it's missing the part where your royal jester gets a kiss after the bonk. Thank you for another year of letting me be your favorite fool.\n\nAll my love,\nYour Jester, Jordan\""
