    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor design that brings peaceful closure to the card's story. On a soft, cream-colored background with visible paper texture, there are two single, empty tortoise shells resting side-by-side in the grass, subtly referencing the characters from the front cover. Delicate watercolor washes of green and yellow create a serene, minimalist scene. The decorative elements are focused on the center and left, leaving the bottom-right corner completely clear for a QR code. The mood is quiet, humorous, and artistic, using the same soft color palette and flowing brushwork as the rest of the card.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor painting of two charming, stylized tortoises wearing party hats. The first tortoise is slightly ahead, looking back with a wide, knowing grin at the second tortoise who is comically trying to catch up, tongue sticking out in exertion. The scene is set on a soft, grassy hill under a cheerful, sunny sky. The background is a full-bleed wash of soft blues, greens, and yellows. Centered in a clear area, the text 'Happy Birthday!' is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The overall style is whimsical and playful, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. Key elements are kept away from the edges for safe printing.",
    "leftInterior": "An abstract watercolor artwork that visually represents the concept of time in a playful, whimsical manner. A beautiful, full-bleed spiral of overlapping clock faces, all stylized and without hands, cascades across the page. The clocks are painted in soft, blended watercolor shades of teal, orange, and gold, matching the card's palette. Some clocks are faded, others more vibrant, creating a sense of depth and movement. The design is purely artistic and decorative, with organic paint bleeds and visible paper texture, creating an innovative and memorable visual that complements the humorous tone of the card.",
    "rightInterior": "A beautiful watercolor design featuring the handwritten message integrated into artistic framing elements. The message is written in a beautiful, clearly readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script that feels personal and warm. The text 'Bob,\nHappy birthday! I was going to make a joke about you getting old, but then I realized I didn't want to be reminded that I'm right there with you. Hope you have a fantastic day!\n- Alex' is centered. Framing the message are whimsical, sprawling vines with small, colorful party streamers and tiny, subtle tortoise shell motifs woven in, all painted in the same soft watercolor style as the rest of the card. The background is a gentle wash of ivory and soft blue, with artistic brush strokes and paper texture. The design is sophisticated yet lighthearted, providing a beautiful and unique showcase for the heartfelt, humorous message, ensuring all text is safely positioned away from the edges."
