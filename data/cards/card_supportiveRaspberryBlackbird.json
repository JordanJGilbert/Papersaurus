    "frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday card with a retro, cartoonish digital art style. The color palette is dominated by muted teal, dusty beige, and metallic grays with accents of orange and brown. The main subjects are two robots in the center. The robot on the left, labeled \"CRAIG-BOT,\" has a distressed expression with wide, shocked eyes and sweat droplets flying from its head. It is a lighter, shiny gray. The robot on the right, labeled \"JORDAN-BOT,\" is a darker gray, has a wide, mischievous grin, and is pointing at the \"CRAIG-BOT\" with its left hand and patting its chest with its right. Behind the robots is a background depicting a retro laboratory or computer room with panels of blinking lights, readouts, and circuitry in shades of teal and beige. Above the robots, a jagged, starburst speech bubble contains the text \"SYSTEM ERROR! AGE DETECTED!\" in bold, all-caps, black sans-serif font. Below the robots, at the bottom of the card, the text \"Happy Birthday!\" is displayed in large, friendly, orange, rounded, serif font with a subtle drop shadow. The composition is balanced, with the robots as the clear focal point, framed by the background elements and the text. The mood is humorous and lighthearted, playing on the theme of aging in a robotic context. Decorative elements are limited to the detailed rendering of the robots and the lab equipment, as well as the distressed texture on the beige background.",
    "backCover": "Back cover design for a birthday card with a minimalist and humorous aesthetic. The style is photorealistic, focusing on a single, highly detailed, silver Phillips head screw positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame. Adjacent to the head of the screw, towards the bottom right, is a small, glossy, bright orange droplet, resembling a drop of liquid or paint. The background is a soft, neutral, pale beige or off-white, creating a clean and modern look. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting subtle shadows that give the screw and droplet a sense of dimension and realism. There is ample negative space, particularly in the upper half of the image, which would be suitable for text or a QR code. The overall composition is clean, uncluttered, and visually striking, providing a simple yet effective humorous punchline that complements the likely comedic tone of a \"make it funny\" birthday card, possibly implying a slightly off-kilter or \"screwed up\" celebration. There is no visible text or QR code in this specific image, but the design allows for their placement in the open space.",
    "leftInterior": "Left interior page of a birthday card with a detailed, retro blueprint illustration of a mechanical arm, labeled \"MODEL-25\". The illustration is rendered in a detailed, engraved, or linocut style, with fine hatching and cross-hatching to create depth and texture. The primary color palette consists of a dark teal or deep blue background with white or light gray lines mimicking a blueprint grid. The mechanical arm itself is depicted in shades of grey and silver, with subtle metallic highlights.\n\nThe mechanical arm is a complex, articulated structure, starting with a circular base and extending upwards through a segmented torso featuring bellows-like sections and segmented piping. Key components are labeled with humorous, anthropomorphic names like \"FRIENDSHIP FLANGE\", \"PAT-ON-THE-BACK ACTUATOR\", \"HMUUIITY JOINT\", \"EMPATHY HOUSING\", \"HOPE SPRING\", \"COMPANION COUPLING\", \"COURTESY CONDUIT\", \"UNITY UNIVERSAL JOINT\", \"GOLIDAITY SERVO\", and \"GRASPING MOTOR\". The typography for these labels is a clean, sans-serif font, with the main \"MODEL-25\" title at the top rendered in a bold, distressed block font.\n\nTo the right of the arm, there is a circular seal or emblem with \"MODEL-25 CERTIFIED PRIME\" around its edge, encircling an atomic symbol with radiating lines. The overall composition is balanced, with the arm dominating the center-left and the seal providing a focal point on the right. The style evokes a vintage technical manual or a blueprint from a science fiction setting, with a slightly aged or textured appearance to the paper. The design elements are precise and illustrative, creating a visually engaging and subtly humorous representation of a \"friendship machine.\"",
    "rightInterior": "Right interior page of a birthday card designed for message space with a prominent, stylized circuit board design as the primary decorative element. The circuit board features bold, flowing lines in orange and thinner white lines, creating a network of interconnected pathways and circular nodes. These lines frame an off-white, slightly textured, octagonal area designated for the handwritten message. The circuit board extends from the edges of the card inwards, reaching towards the central message space and creating a visually engaging border that does not obstruct the writing area. The background of the card is a dark teal color with a subtle dot pattern, reminiscent of textured paper. The overall artistic style is clean, graphic, and slightly retro, with a clear separation between the decorative and functional elements. The printed text, \"Craig, Happy birthday!\", \"Best, Jordan\", is presented in a sans-serif font, with the main birthday message area left entirely blank for personalization. The design effectively balances the intricate circuit board motif with ample, clear space for a handwritten message, making it both visually appealing and practical."
