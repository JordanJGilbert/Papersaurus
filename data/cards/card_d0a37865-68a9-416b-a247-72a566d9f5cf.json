    "backCover": "A simple and elegant watercolor back cover with a soft, cream-colored textured wash. In the top-left corner, there's a small, delicate watercolor painting of a single olive branch. The design is understated and natural, with the bottom-right corner left clear for the QR code. The style is gentle watercolor with subtle color variations.",
    "frontCover": "An adorable and charming watercolor illustration with a gentle, earthy color palette (terracotta, olive green, dusty blue, cream). A sweet, cartoonish giraffe is sitting on the grass, carefully placing a tiny graduation cap on the head of a small, fluffy puppy who is looking up with a proud smile. The scene is set in a peaceful meadow with soft, rolling hills in the background. The text \"Congratulations\" is written in a lovely, flowing script in a dark olive green color, positioned in the sky area above the characters. The style is a soft and delicate watercolor with layered washes, fine details, and a cozy, heartwarming feel on textured paper.",
    "leftInterior": "A whimsical, full-bleed watercolor map, designed in a charming, hand-drawn style with an earthy color palette. The map shows a path labeled \"The Road to Success.\" It starts at a little kennel icon labeled \"Start\" and ends at a tall tree icon labeled \"You Are Here!\" A giraffe is shown peering over the top of the tall tree, waving down. Tiny dog paw prints follow the entire path. The style is quaint and detailed, like a page from a storybook.",
    "rightInterior": "A clean watercolor background with a gentle, earthy terracotta wash that is darker at the edges and lighter in the center, creating a soft vignette effect. The paper texture is clearly visible. In the middle of the light area, \"MESSAGE GOES HERE\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, dark brown handwritten cursive script. The design is warm, inviting, and easy to read."
