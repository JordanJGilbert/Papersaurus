    "backCover": "A simple and serene watercolor design that provides a peaceful conclusion. On a soft, textured paper background, a single, oversized red ribbon, identical in style and color to the one on the front cover, lies gracefully curled in the center-left portion of the card. A few stray, light blue watercolor splotches are scattered around it, echoing the sky from the front cover. The design is minimal and elegant, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. The overall feel is quiet and artistic, a gentle nod to the humor of the front cover. The artwork uses a watercolor style with soft, blended colors and visible paper texture.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous and charming watercolor scene. On a lush green hill under a sunny, light blue sky with fluffy white clouds, a cartoon version of a man (Jordan) is playfully presenting himself as a gift. He is wearing a giant, comically oversized red ribbon tied around his chest in a big bow. He stands with a proud, goofy grin. Next to him, a cartoon version of a woman (Lao Lao) is laughing heartily, her hands on her hips. Both characters are rendered in a soft, friendly, and stylized cartoon style with simplified features, not realistic portraits. In the center of the image, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script. The entire scene is painted in a vibrant watercolor style with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, creating a lighthearted and joyful atmosphere. Key elements are kept away from the edges.",
    "leftInterior": "A whimsical and funny watercolor illustration showcasing a pile of rejected, comically extravagant gift ideas. At the bottom of the pile is a shiny, generic red sports car. On top of that rests a small, treasure chest overflowing with sparkling (but fake-looking) jewels and gold coins. Near the top, there's a miniature cartoon rocket ship with a 'Sold' sign on it, and the very peak of the pile is a tiny, generic private island with a single palm tree. Each item is crossed out with a playful red 'X' painted in a loose watercolor stroke. The scene is lighthearted and goofy, rendered in the same soft watercolor style as the rest of the card, with a warm, bright color palette. This page contains no text or characters.",
    "rightInterior": "An elegant watercolor design that beautifully frames the handwritten message. The text is the centerpiece, written in a beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels personal and warm. The message reads: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! I was going to get you a super expensive gift, but then I remembered having me as your boyfriend is the greatest gift of all. You're welcome! I hope you have a day that's as amazing as you are. Love, Jordan\". The text is artistically arranged in the center of the page. Surrounding the message, two beautiful watercolor red ribbons cascade down from the top corners, looping and twirling gracefully around the words before pooling at the bottom, creating a sophisticated and artistic border. The background is a soft, textured off-white with subtle, light blue watercolor washes, ensuring the text is perfectly legible. The overall style is elegant, cohesive, and innovative, keeping all text safely away from the edges."
