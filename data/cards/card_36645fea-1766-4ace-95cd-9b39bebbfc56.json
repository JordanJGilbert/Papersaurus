    "backCover": "A serene, minimalist watercolor painting on a textured paper background. In the center, a single, elegantly painted corn dog with a bite taken out of it, rendered with soft, flowing colors and artistic brush strokes. From the corn dog, a few faint, colorful wisps of watercolor paint rise and trail off towards the top of the card, subtly hinting at fireworks. The style is flat 2D. The background is a gentle wash of the night sky color from the front cover, with organic paint bleeds. The bottom-right corner, approximately 1 inch square, is left completely blank and white for a QR code. NO PEOPLE.",
    "frontCover": "A humorous watercolor painting of cartoon characters Jordan and Lao Lao at Great America amusement park. Jordan is hysterically screaming with his eyes squeezed shut, arms flailing wildly in the air. Lao Lao is right next to him on the roller coaster, laughing joyfully with a big smile, one hand up in a \"rock on\" gesture and the other holding a half-eaten corn dog. In the background, vibrant and slightly blurry watercolor fireworks, reminiscent of the Fourth of July, explode in the sky above the amusement park's silhouette. The scene is full of dynamic energy, with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background. Centered in the middle of the illustration, in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Thank you\". The art is flat 2D, perfect for printing.\n\nCRITICAL CHARACTER REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS: I have provided a reference photo as input image.

    "leftInterior": "A beautiful full-bleed decorative watercolor painting. The design features a continuous, abstract pattern of vibrant and blurry firework bursts, echoing the style from the front cover. The fireworks are rendered with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background. The composition is artistic and celebratory, filling the entire space without any text or characters. The art is flat 2D and visually cohesive with the overall card design. NO PEOPLE.",
    "rightInterior": "A decorative watercolor illustration on a textured paper background. The artwork features a gentle cascade of colorful, soft-focus firework sparks drifting down from the top-left and bottom-right corners, creating a beautiful border. Centrally located, the following message is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script: \"Lao Lao, thanks for an amazing summer! I'm still not sure what was more explosive, the Fourth of July fireworks or my stomach after all those rollercoasters at the amusement park. Honestly, surviving both with you officially makes you the best girlfriend ever.\\n\\nAll my love,\\nJordan\". The art uses the same soft, flowing color palette and artistic brush strokes as the front cover, with organic paint bleeds. The design is flat 2D. NO PEOPLE."
