The scene is a sunny, golden sand beach under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds.\n\nIn the center, there is a magnificent, large sandcastle meticulously sculpted to look exactly like a classic white Chinese food takeout box, complete with the red pagoda logo and wire handle. This sandcastle-takeout box is in a defensive posture. From the top of the box, large, dark tapioca boba pearls are being launched like cannonballs.\n\nSurrounding the base of the sandcastle is a comical army of small, bright red crabs. Each crab brandishes a pair of wooden chopsticks, holding them like tiny swords or spears, as they humorously and chaotically attempt to storm the sandcastle. A few boba pearls have already landed on the sand, creating small, splashy craters. The scene is filled with playful action and movement, with soft watercolor splashes and gentle color bleeds adding to the charm. The overall tone is funny, absurd, and endearing.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in the sky in a beautiful, elegant, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\""}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752445829.275722, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-36871b53-8c18-4d88-bbc2-8b266cd17413", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_008cf631.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752445829.275722, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant and whimsical watercolor painting for a greeting card front.
