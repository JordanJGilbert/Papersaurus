In a whimsical, surreal landscape, Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo are transformed into cartoon characters.

Instead of trees, the landscape is dotted with giant pieces of sushi\u2014a massive tuna nigiri here, a huge salmon roll there\u2014and oversized, juicy wagyu steak slices that stick out of the rice like rock formations. Flying alongside them are whimsical steamed dumplings with tiny wings, and floating rivers of code (like green Matrix-style numbers) meander through the scene like ethereal streams. Lao Lao is laughing as she hands Jordan a pair of chopsticks, and he looks thrilled, ready to grab a piece of flying food. The overall atmosphere is magical, playful, and humorous, with a pastel color palette and soft, ethereal lighting. Centered in a clear space in the sky, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The characters wear the clothing from the photo, but without any logos."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555515.2179918, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-96459cae-4ca4-4932-af08-9dcfa0e7feec", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_06fbab16.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555515.2179918, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front cover, dreamy fantasy art style.
