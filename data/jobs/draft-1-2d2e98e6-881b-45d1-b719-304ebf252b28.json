They are both wearing colorful, slightly-too-large birthday party hats. Lao Lao is wearing a light blue sweatshirt and Jordan is wearing a tan hoodie, consistent with the reference photo.\n\nIn the lower right corner, a tiny, mischievous puppy is triumphantly trotting away with a ridiculously oversized slice of pepperoni pizza in its mouth, the cheese stretching comically back towards an open pizza box in the center. The puppy has a look of pure glee.\n\nLao Lao and Jordan are in the center, reacting with dramatic, playful desperation. Lao Lao is kneeling on one knee, holding out a single dog treat with an exaggerated pleading expression. Jordan is beside her, dramatically reaching out with both hands towards the puppy, his face a mix of humorous shock and mock-desperation. Two steaming mugs of coffee sit near the pizza box, one with a \"J\" and one with an \"L,\" momentarily forgotten in the pizza chaos.\n\nThe entire scene is framed by a beautiful, hand-painted botanical border composed of lush eucalyptus branches, delicate ferns, and clusters of small white flowers, adding an elegant and whimsical touch to the funny scene.\n\nCentered in the space above the couple's heads, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script in a dark olive green color."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0f1bf2a18918634e4dd4baf99cc9e8fa"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752431727.5243309, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-2d2e98e6-881b-45d1-b719-304ebf252b28", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_6bf45d45.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752431727.5243309, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front.
