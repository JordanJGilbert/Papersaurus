{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Minimalist greeting card front, 2D flat illustration style with simple elegant shapes and a clean white background. Centered text in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script says \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\". The artwork depicts cartoon versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo, full-body, in a funny and dynamic scene. Jordan is heroically snowboarding down a giant, perfectly marbled slice of wagyu steak as if it's a snowy mountain. He is mid-turn, kicking up a spray of rice instead of snow. He is wearing his dark t-shirt from the photo along with snowboard gear. Lao Lao is at the bottom of the \"steak mountain\" with a joyful, cheering expression, wearing her white jacket from the photo. She is holding a pair of giant chopsticks, ready to catch him. The scene is humorously littered with other personal details: sushi rolls like salmon nigiri and tuna maki are scattered around like rocks on the slope, a Chinese takeout box sits open nearby, and floating in the air are minimalist green icons representing lines of code, like \"< / >\" and \"{ }\". The overall composition is playful, clean, and full of personal jokes."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752554097.3119068, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-ae20e1ab-4833-4af2-85a1-4c0304fac96a", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5d8c852b.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752554097.3119068, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Minimalist greeting card front, 2D flat illustration style with simple elegant shapes and a clean white background.
