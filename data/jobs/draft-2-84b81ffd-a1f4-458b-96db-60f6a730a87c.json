{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Vibrant and humorous comic book cover illustration of Lao Lao and Jordan on a beautiful tropical beach, flat 2D art style with bold ink outlines, dynamic panel layout, and saturated colors.\n\nIn the main panel, Lao Lao, based on the reference photo, is depicted as a superheroine, mid-action, laughing joyfully. She's wearing a brightly colored superhero version of her blue sweatshirt. Instead of a cape, a giant, steaming xiao long bao (soup dumpling) is comically strapped to her back like a jetpack.\n\nJordan, based on the reference photo, is depicted as her loyal sidekick, wearing a version of his tan hoodie. He stands beside her with an exaggerated look of awe and a wide grin, holding up a pair of giant chopsticks like they are powerful weapons.\n\nThe beach scene is stylized with pop art flair: turquoise waves crash with \"SPLASH!\" sound effects, the sand is golden yellow with Ben-Day dots, and palm trees sway in the background. Scattered comically on the sand are open Chinese takeout boxes filled with noodles and spring rolls.\n\nIn the center of the image, the text \"Happy Birthday, Super Lao Lao!\" is written in a bold, beautiful, and readable handwritten cursive script, contained within a classic comic book speech bubble or explosion shape. The composition is dynamic and full of energy, perfectly capturing a fun, lighthearted tone."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752447999.2459238, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-84b81ffd-a1f4-458b-96db-60f6a730a87c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_ab06fc50.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447999.2459238, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Vibrant and humorous comic book cover illustration of Lao Lao and Jordan on a beautiful tropical beach, flat 2D art style with bold ink outlines, dynamic panel layout, and saturated colors.\n\nIn the main panel, Lao Lao, based on the reference photo, is depicted as a superheroine, mid-action, laughing joyfully.
