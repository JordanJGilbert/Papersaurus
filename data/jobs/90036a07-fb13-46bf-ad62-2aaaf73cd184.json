In the center, there is a cartoon illustration of a happy couple, Lao Lao and Jordan, who highly resemble the people in the reference photo.\n\nLao Lao, on the left, is an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair. She is smiling, wearing thin gold-rimmed glasses, a light blue crewneck sweatshirt (with no logos or text), and black pants. Her arms are crossed in front of her.\n\nJordan, on the right, is a young man of Southeast Asian descent with short, textured dark hair. He is standing slightly behind Lao Lao, hugging her from behind with his arms wrapped around her waist. He has a big, warm smile and is wearing a tan/brown hoodie (with no logos or text) and dark reddish-brown pants.\n\nThey are playfully struggling over a giant, comically oversized birthday cupcake with bright pink frosting and a single lit candle on top, holding it between them. Lao Lao is trying to pull it towards herself with a mischievous grin, while Jordan is playfully trying to pull it back, laughing.\n\nThe couple is framed by an elegant, asymmetrical wreath of detailed botanical elements. This includes lush monstera leaves, delicate fern fronds, eucalyptus branches, and vibrant, blooming pink peonies and white anemones, all rendered in soft, organic watercolor textures.\n\nIn the center of the card, slightly overlapping the botanical wreath at the top, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite human bean\" in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script.
