{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "[ID-cd50f028-5f79-43f6-88ba-286386f90e39] A vibrant and humorous birthday card in a dynamic comic book art style. The scene is an action-packed, funny moment of chaos. A tiny, mischievous dog, possibly a small terrier mix, is triumphantly running away with an absurdly large, cheesy slice of pepperoni pizza that is bigger than the dog itself. The dog is in the foreground, creating a sense of motion.\n\nIn the background, Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are illustrated as comic book characters, both wearing colorful, cone-shaped party hats. They have comically horrified and dramatic expressions. Lao Lao, wearing a bright blue sweatshirt, is on one knee, reaching out with an empty dog bowl, trying to tempt the dog back. Jordan, in a tan hoodie, stands with a dramatic \"Noooo!\" pose, one hand over his face in mock despair and the other pointing towards the thieving dog.\n\nThe scene is framed with classic comic book elements: a bold, angled panel border, action lines streaking from the running dog, and a small, explosive \"KAPOW!\" sound effect bubble near the open pizza box, which is tipped over on the floor. The background is simple but colorful, suggesting a living room with birthday decorations like stray balloons and confetti.\n\nCentered on the card, floating above the main action in a clean space, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, hand-drawn cursive script with a slight bounce to it, contrasting with the sharp lines of the comic art. The color palette is bright and saturated with primary colors, typical of classic comics, using flat 2D artwork with bold black outlines and Ben-Day dot shading effects for a vintage feel."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0f1bf2a18918634e4dd4baf99cc9e8fa"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752431728.3330057, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-366cdd7a-7388-4070-8a1d-56c9f6b3f138", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_ffc8b335.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752431728.3330057, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "[ID-cd50f028-5f79-43f6-88ba-286386f90e39] A vibrant and humorous birthday card in a dynamic comic book art style.
