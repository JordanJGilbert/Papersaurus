{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo. Lao Lao, a young woman of East Asian descent with long dark brown hair and round gold glasses, wearing a dark grey long-sleeved shirt, is depicted as a regal queen sitting on a throne made of a giant, steaming bowl of Chinese porridge (congee). She holds a boba tea like a royal scepter in one hand and delicately takes a bite of a giant banh mi sandwich with the other, a content and happy expression on her face. Jordan, a young man of Southeast Asian descent with spiky, textured dark brown hair and a big smile, wearing a maroon t-shirt, is on one knee beside the throne, presenting the banh mi to her on a silver platter with a comically adoring and subservient look. The entire scene has a soft, lighthearted feel with flowing colors, artistic paint splatters, and a visible paper texture.\n\nCentered on the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text:\n\"Happy Birthday to my Queen\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-af382523c5c6f9706b5b3d7417ab2736"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752289012.4866087, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-5becd4c4-3bd2-4e87-885c-c7abc9451f60", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_1a3cd83c.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752289012.4866087, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo.
