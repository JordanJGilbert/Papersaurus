{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover in a beautiful botanical illustration style. The scene features cartoon/illustrated versions of two specific people, rendered in a flat 2D style perfect for printing.\n\n**Person 1 (Jordan):** A young woman of East Asian descent, aged 20-25, positioned on the left. She has long, straight black hair, wears thin-rimmed glasses, and has a warm, smiling expression. She is wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a circular logo on the front that says 'ROCKY MO...' and '...IDGE', and black pants.\n\n**Person 2 (Implied Jordan's partner):** A young man of Southeast Asian or East Asian descent, aged 20-25, positioned on the right, standing behind the woman with his arms wrapped around her in a loving hug. He has short, textured black hair and a broad, happy smile. He is wearing a tan/light brown hoodie and dark maroon sweatpants.\n\n**Scene & Humor:** The couple is comically tangled and struggling to hold up an enormous, oversized birthday cake that is precariously tilting. The cake is elaborately decorated with botanical elements like sugar flowers and piped vines, matching the overall style. Little bits of frosting are flying off. Their expressions are a mix of their original smiles combined with a slight, funny strain from the weight of the massive cake.\n\n**Artistic Style:** The entire illustration is in a detailed botanical style. Intricate, elegant floral arrangements of peonies, eucalyptus, and ferns gracefully frame the scene, growing from the bottom corners and arching softly around the couple. The background is a soft, solid pastel color, allowing the characters and botanical elements to stand out.\n\n**Text:** The words \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\" are written in the center of the card in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script. The text is positioned safely away from the edges.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-209671b9a3698d8f64f92ba831f02c6c"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752263516.9203868, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-7af8cff2-fcc5-4d30-ad16-b555c1d2b80a", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_95d275b6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752263516.9203868, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover in a beautiful botanical illustration style.
