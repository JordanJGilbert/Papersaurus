In a dynamic and heartfelt composition, Grandpa (man from the photo) and Tong Tong (child on the right in the red sweater) are the stars of their own comic book adventure. They are depicted as cartoon characters, wearing the same clothing from the photo but without any logos. They stand proudly on the deck of a classic wooden Chinese fishing junk boat. Grandpa has a loving arm around Tong Tong's shoulder, and Tong Tong is beaming with joy, pointing excitedly towards the viewer. The boat is adorned with festive birthday banners.\n\nThe background is a vibrant, stylized seascape with dynamic waves, rendered with bold lines and a bright, saturated color palette typical of comic art. In the sky, dramatic clouds are shaped like auspicious Chinese opera masks, with flowing, cloud-like beards. Leaping gracefully from the waves around the boat are stylized comic book-style fish, crabs, and shrimp, adding a playful and personalized touch of seafood.\n\nThe overall feeling is action-packed yet deeply emotional, celebrating their shared adventures and memories. In the center of the card, floating amidst the scene, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa!\" written in a beautiful, flowing white handwritten cursive script with a bold black outline to make it pop."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Grandpa", "fromField": "Tong Tong", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-8aeb0d618355b483f19c973a103cffd6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752513914.8581388, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-4c24addb-4049-47f0-850e-04a8fe61b549", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8fcb9dc5.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752513914.8581388, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D comic book art for a greeting card front.
