The scene features two charming, slightly frazzled-looking cartoon garden gnomes attempting to untangle a ridiculously long and knotted string of birthday bunting from a large, leafy monstera plant.

The bunting is colorful with festive patterns. The entire illustration is framed by lush, elegant botanical elements like ferns, trailing ivy, and delicate wildflowers, rendered in a detailed yet clean illustrative style with a soft, natural color palette. Centered in a clear space amongst the foliage, the text \"another year, another glorious mess\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script.
