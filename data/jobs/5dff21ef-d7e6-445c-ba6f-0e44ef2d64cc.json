In the center, a slightly flustered, charming cartoon superhero in a comically ill-fitting costume (maybe the cape is a dish towel) is holding a giant, over-the-top, melting birthday cake with way too many lit candles. The superhero has a look of mild panic and exertion. A large, dynamic speech bubble emerges from the superhero, exclaiming \"HOLY SMOKES, JOHNNY! THAT'S A LOT OF CANDLES!\" The background features classic comic book elements like a vibrant sunburst effect, action lines, and subtle halftone patterns. In the safe center area, elegantly scripted in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive font, is the word \"Happy Birthday\". The entire scene has bold outlines, vibrant primary colors, and a dynamic, energetic feel reminiscent of a vintage superhero comic book cover.", "backCover": "A minimalist design in a flat 2D comic book style, featuring vibrant primary colors. The top-left corner has a small, stylized 'KA-POW!' sound effect graphic with bold black outlines and a subtle halftone dot pattern.
