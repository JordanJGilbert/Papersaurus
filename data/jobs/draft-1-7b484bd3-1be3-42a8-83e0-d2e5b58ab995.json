{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny botanical scene. Illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao (from photo on left) and Jordan (from photo on right) are the central focus. They are laughing hysterically while sitting on a picnic blanket made of giant, flat nori (seaweed). Instead of a regular picnic, they are surrounded by a feast of oversized, cartoonish sushi pieces: salmon nigiri being used as pillows, and a California roll that's so large they can lean against it. Two adorable cartoon dogs, one a fluffy Corgi and the other a Shiba Inu, are playfully trying to steal pieces of sushi, with one dog wearing a piece of tamago (egg) like a tiny hat.\n\nThe entire scene is framed by a beautiful, lush botanical border of watercolor monstera leaves, eucalyptus branches, and delicate ferns, creating a soft, natural arch. Floating amongst the leaves are a few more whimsical pieces of sushi, like little ikura (salmon roe) that look like berries.\n\nIn the center, slightly above the couple, is the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\" written in a beautiful, elegant, and readable handwritten cursive script in a dark green color that complements the botanical theme.\n\nThe art style is flat 2D illustration, with clean lines, soft watercolor textures, and a bright, cheerful color palette. The overall mood is joyful, personal, and comically charming."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-54ff6f74fce1dd64d545a69e324815e2"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752524077.0899637, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-7b484bd3-1be3-42a8-83e0-d2e5b58ab995", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_965ef09b.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752524077.0899637, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny botanical scene.
