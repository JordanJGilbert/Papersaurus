{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting of a humorous birthday scene for Lao Lao, in a lighthearted and funny style. In the center, a cartoon illustration of an elderly Asian woman (Lao Lao) from the reference photo, wearing her glasses, with her short gray hair, and dressed in her light blue and white patterned collared shirt and dark pants. She is sitting majestically on a grand, ornate golden throne, wearing a silly, oversized, sparkling birthday crown that is slightly tilted on her head. She has a huge, joyful smile, holding a half-eaten, giant peach (a symbol of longevity) in one hand and giving a playful \"rock on\" hand gesture with the other. Flanking her throne are her two grandchildren from the reference photo. The young boy on the left, with his short black hair and glasses, wearing his red short-sleeved shirt and blue shorts, is enthusiastically fanning her with a giant banana leaf, a comical look of effort on his face. The young girl on the right, with her long dark hair in a ponytail, wearing her purple t-shirt and light-colored shorts, is holding a tray with a single, wobbling cupcake that has a huge, brightly lit candle on it, looking at her grandmother with adoration. The entire scene is set against a soft, white background with celebratory, colorful watercolor splatters and confetti floating around them. Centered in the middle of the design, in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to the Queen, Lao Lao!\". The artwork is flat 2D, with artistic brush strokes, soft flowing colors, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds characteristic of a genuine watercolor painting.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-7104b2361d48d285e7f3d730f9b28858"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752282766.3744056, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-bfe02c51-3f14-4473-9417-10ff82dd7ee9", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_a7b58766.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752282766.3744056, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting of a humorous birthday scene for Lao Lao, in a lighthearted and funny style.
