{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a vibrant and dynamic comic book panel bursting with action and humor. In the center, a 2D illustrated version of Jordan from the photo, depicted as a superhero with a confident, joyful grin. He's wearing a slightly more stylized version of his dark blue t-shirt from the photo, now with a custom superhero emblem on the chest that creatively combines a snowboard and a pair of chopsticks. He's expertly snowboarding down a snowy mountain slope made entirely of giant, perfectly cooked wagyu steak with marbled fat details.\n\nOn his back, Lao Lao, from the photo, is illustrated in a matching comic book style, wearing her white zip-up jacket. She clings to him piggyback-style with a happy, excited expression, holding up a giant pair of chopsticks like ski poles.\n\nInstead of snow, they are kicking up a flurry of binary code (0s and 1s) and stylized icons of sushi rolls and Chinese takeout boxes that fly through the air around them. The background is a dramatic, colorful sky with classic comic book dot patterns (Ben-Day dots) and a large, explosive \"KA-POW!\" style graphic behind them.\n\nIn the center of the card, layered over the scene, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, bold, and readable handwritten cursive script in a contrasting bright color like yellow or white with a black outline to make it pop. The overall composition is energetic, fun, and full of personal details, with a polished, flat 2D graphic novel aesthetic."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555353.374316, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-30baee0a-07ae-44e3-b70c-d2eac77d2b59", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_b1be3bf4.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555353.374316, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a vibrant and dynamic comic book panel bursting with action and humor.
