{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D greeting card illustration. In the center, a cartoon groundhog is depicted wearing a tiny, festive party hat askew on its head. The groundhog has a slightly grumpy, bewildered expression as it peeks out of a lush, oversized pot of vibrant, leafy monstera plants and trailing philodendron vines. The scene is a beautiful botanical composition, with detailed, stylized leaves in various shades of green, creating a rich, textured backdrop. Scattered amongst the leaves are a few tiny, whimsical party decorations like a single dropped confetti piece and a miniature, unlit birthday candle stuck in the soil.\n\nIn the center of the card, nestled amongst the leaves just above the groundhog, the phrase \"Another year older?\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The overall aesthetic is a delightful mix of sophisticated botanical art and playful cartoon humor, set against a clean, soft cream background. The composition is focused and balanced, with the main subject and text occupying the central area of the card."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752384237.3021786, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-fc2ccc15-aa8f-4e28-85e1-aadfb9ec8484", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_09766fe5.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752384237.3021786, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D greeting card illustration.
