A charming and humorous beach scene with a clean, simple aesthetic against a soft cream background. In the center, cartoon illustrated versions of Lao Lao (person on the left in the photo) and Jordan (person on the right in the photo) are building a giant sandcastle together. The sandcastle is comedically shaped like a massive Chinese food takeout box, complete with tiny sand chopstick details sticking out of the top. Jordan is patting the \"box\" with a small shovel, and Lao Lao is adding a \"scallion\" made of seaweed to the top, both with happy, laughing expressions. They are wearing the same jackets from the reference photo, but adapted for a beach setting (unzipped or worn casually). Tiny, simple waves lap at the edge of the scene.\n\nCentered above the illustration, the text reads \"Happy Anniversary, Lao Lao!\" in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The overall composition is balanced, lighthearted, and stylish."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-d1af38ed4db92f93d2da15e4947adf2d"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752504689.4529922, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-b81bc0ce-91b5-41a8-8086-7a2820b8f744", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_544f8749.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752504689.4529922, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Minimalist greeting card front, 2D flat illustration.
