{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card for Sarah, humorous and lighthearted. In the center, a cartoon illustration of the two people from the reference photo (0937c239-e751-4f1d-bd53-a63bd1dd93b2), highly resembling them. They are standing next to each other, looking slightly overwhelmed and comically buried up to their waists in a giant pile of colorful birthday presents and tangled ribbons. The man on the left has a party hat slightly askew on his head, and the woman on the right is holding a single, unlit birthday candle with a puzzled expression. Their clothing, hairstyles, facial features (including glasses for the woman), and body proportions are exactly the same as in the photo. The background is a soft, celebratory wash of pastel colors with light confetti details. In the safe center area, above the characters, the text \"Happy Birthday, Sarah! Hope it's heaps of fun!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The entire design is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sarah", "fromField": "James", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ed65d0107a99ea743b81f9b1e076cb0f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278820.4796383, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-01b6b016-f3c0-4eb2-99cb-9ce50bb79929", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_01e07dae.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278820.4796383, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card for Sarah, humorous and lighthearted.
