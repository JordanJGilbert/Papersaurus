{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front cover, in a soft flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nThe scene depicts five people from the reference photo, transformed into charming watercolor cartoon characters, standing happily together. In the center, position two oversized, comical sushi rolls, a tuna nigiri and a salmon nigiri, standing upright and as tall as the people. The five family members are playfully interacting with these giant sushi pieces.\n\nFrom left to right:\n- The man on the far left, with short graying hair, wearing a black jacket and grey pants, has one arm draped over the giant tuna nigiri, smiling warmly.\n- The young man next to him, with dark hair, wearing a grey and black jacket and black pants, is giving a thumbs-up, looking excitedly at the sushi.\n- The woman in the middle, with long dark hair, wearing a dark jacket and jeans, is peeking out from behind the giant salmon nigiri with a playful smile.\n- The woman to her right, with shoulder-length highlighted hair, wearing a burgundy puffer coat and jeans, is hugging the giant salmon nigiri with a joyful expression.\n- The young woman on the far right, with long dark hair, wearing a black and white sweater, a black scarf, and light blue patterned jeans, is holding up a giant pair of chopsticks, ready to \"eat\" the oversized sushi.\n\nThe background is a soft, artistic wash of watercolor suggesting a classic Japanese landscape, with a subtle silhouette of Mt. Fuji and a few cherry blossom branches with pink flowers arching into the top corners. The overall atmosphere is humorous, joyful, and celebrates their trip and love for sushi.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Hope your trip was raw-some!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "japan trip", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-98cdd699843ffbfa798f80235df750f3"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752296405.5915816, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-91287ef1-5368-48c4-bfbe-91d59b6c4f56", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8a7a6c82.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752296405.5915816, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front cover, in a soft flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nThe scene depicts five people from the reference photo, transformed into charming watercolor cartoon characters, standing happily together.
