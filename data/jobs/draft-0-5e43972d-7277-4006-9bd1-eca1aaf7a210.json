{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny watercolor painting featuring cartoon versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo. The scene is a chaotic and joyful mountaintop celebration of all his favorite things. Jordan, in his dark blue shirt, is hilariously trying to balance on a snowboard that is surfing down a giant river made of flowing soy sauce. He has a wide, happy, and slightly panicked expression, holding a laptop in one hand that has binary code (0s and 1s) floating off the screen like confetti. Lao Lao, in her white jacket, is sitting cheerfully on his shoulders, holding up a perfectly marbled, sizzling wagyu steak on a fork like a trophy. The snowy mountain slopes around them are not made of snow, but are creatively composed of fluffy white rice. Dotted across the rice slopes are vibrant watercolor splashes of sushi rolls, sashimi, and Chinese dumplings instead of trees and rocks. The sky is a soft blend of watercolor blues and whites.\n\nCentered in a clear area of the sky above them, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script.\n\nThe overall style is flat 2D art, perfect for a card, with the characteristic soft edges, bleeding colors, and charming imperfections of a genuine watercolor painting. The composition is dynamic and full of playful energy."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752554097.675267, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-5e43972d-7277-4006-9bd1-eca1aaf7a210", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_dc86f325.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752554097.675267, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny watercolor painting featuring cartoon versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo.
