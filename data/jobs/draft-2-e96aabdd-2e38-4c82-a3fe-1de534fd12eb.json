{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of a cartoon couple, posed for a birthday card cover against a simple, light-colored background that mimics paper texture. The illustration is humorous and lighthearted.\n\nThe couple is based on the people in the reference photo. The woman, Lao Lao, is on the left. She is an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair parted on the side. She wears thin, gold-rimmed glasses and has a joyful smile. She is wearing a slightly oversized light blue sweatshirt (with no text or logos) and black pants.\n\nThe man, Jordan, stands behind her on the right, wrapping his arms around her waist in a loving hug. He is a Southeast Asian man with short, textured dark hair. He has a big, warm smile showing his teeth. He is wearing a tan-colored hoodie (with no text or logos) and dark maroon pants.\n\nThe humorous twist is that Jordan is playfully and exaggeratedly lifting Lao Lao slightly off the ground, as if she weighs nothing, with a comical expression of mock-effort on his face. Lao Lao is laughing, looking out at the viewer, with her arms crossed comfortably over his. Floating around them are a few whimsical, colorful watercolor splotches that look like confetti.\n\nIn the center of the card, below the couple, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person to pick on\" written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script in a dark teal color. The overall style is soft and flowing, with visible artistic brush strokes and organic paint bleeds characteristic of watercolor.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284544.837835, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-e96aabdd-2e38-4c82-a3fe-1de534fd12eb", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_bd7ea382.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284544.837835, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of a cartoon couple, posed for a birthday card cover against a simple, light-colored background that mimics paper texture.
