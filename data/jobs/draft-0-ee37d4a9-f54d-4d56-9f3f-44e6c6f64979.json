{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous watercolor scene for a greeting card front. Illustrated cartoon versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo are snowboarding down a snowy mountain slope made of giant, stylized sushi rolls and wagyu steak. The background is a soft, dreamlike mountainscape with Chinese lanterns floating in the sky.\n\nJordan, wearing a dark navy t-shirt, is in the foreground, expertly navigating his snowboard. His snowboard is cleverly designed to look like a laptop keyboard, with ones and zeros trailing behind him like snow spray. He has a joyful, laughing expression.\n\nLao Lao, wearing a white zip-up top, snowboards playfully beside him, her arm linked with his. She's holding up a pair of oversized chopsticks, trying to nab a floating piece of illustrated Chinese takeout (like a dumpling or noodle) that's drifting by like a snowflake.\n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a beautiful, flowing watercolor style with soft edges and a light, cheerful color palette. Playful splashes of color add to the dynamic and humorous energy.\n\nIn the clear sky area in the center, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. Flat 2D artwork, perfect for printing."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555521.978295, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-ee37d4a9-f54d-4d56-9f3f-44e6c6f64979", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_684f665c.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555521.978295, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous watercolor scene for a greeting card front.
