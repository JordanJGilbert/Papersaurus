{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A humorous and lighthearted watercolor scene featuring cartoon-style characters of a young couple, Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo.\n\nLao Lao is an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair, wearing thin, round gold-rimmed glasses. She is smiling warmly and is dressed in a light blue sweatshirt (omit any logos) and black pants. Jordan is an East Asian man with short, textured dark hair. He is smiling broadly and is standing behind Lao Lao, hugging her from the back. He wears a tan hoodie (omit any logos) and dark maroon pants. The illustrated characters must highly resemble the people in the photo, capturing their exact facial features, hairstyles, clothing, and the affectionate pose.\n\nInstead of the realistic waterfront background, the couple is playfully illustrated as if they are tiny figures standing on top of a giant, beautifully decorated birthday cake. The cake has layers of soft pastel watercolor frosting, maybe some sprinkles and a few whimsical, swirly candles. Lao Lao is laughing as she tries to \"steal\" a bit of frosting with her finger, while Jordan is laughing and playfully trying to stop her.\n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a beautiful watercolor style with soft, blended colors, visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. The background is a simple, light wash of color to keep the focus on the couple and the cake.\n\nCentered on the card, below the main illustration, is text in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script that reads: \"Happy Birthday to my sweetest Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284600.4363196, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-296cdc30-2477-4ebe-a952-7f6f8723b558", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_12aa6d75.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284600.4363196, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
