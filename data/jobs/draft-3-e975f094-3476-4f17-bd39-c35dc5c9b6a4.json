{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny dreamy fantasy scene featuring cartoon illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo. The setting is a surreal, magical landscape where their favorite things come to life. In the background, there's a snowy mountain range made of fluffy white rice, with soy sauce rivers flowing down its slopes. Instead of trees, there are giant stalks of broccoli and bok choy.\n\nIn the mid-ground, Jordan is playfully snowboarding down a slope of perfectly seared wagyu steak, kicking up a spray of binary code (0s and 1s) instead of snow. He is wearing his navy blue t-shirt. Lao Lao, wearing her white zip-up top, is sitting nearby on a giant piece of salmon nigiri sushi, laughing and cheering him on. She holds a pair of oversized chopsticks.\n\nFloating gently around them are various magical food items: shrimp dumplings drifting like clouds, sushi rolls (maki) orbiting them like tiny planets, and glowing Chinese lanterns shaped like takeout boxes. The whole scene is bathed in a soft, ethereal glow with pastel colors and magical sparkles.\n\nCentered on the card, in a clear area, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" written in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script. The overall style is flat 2D vector art, charming, and filled with humorous, personal details."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555273.7736492, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-e975f094-3476-4f17-bd39-c35dc5c9b6a4", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_d642a6db.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555273.7736492, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny dreamy fantasy scene featuring cartoon illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo.
