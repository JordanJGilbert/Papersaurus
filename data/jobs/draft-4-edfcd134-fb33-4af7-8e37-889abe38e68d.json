{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a young Asian couple, transformed into humorous cartoon characters, standing side-by-side and comically struggling to lift a giant, steaming, oversized bowl of dumplings that is almost as big as them. The man, on the right, has short, dark, textured hair and is wearing a tan hoodie and dark reddish-maroon pants; he's straining with a funny, exaggerated expression of effort. The woman, on the left, has long, straight, dark hair, is wearing gold-rimmed glasses, a light blue sweatshirt (with no text), and black pants; she's also showing a funny, strained look as she helps lift the heavy bowl. The scene is set against a simple, light-colored background with soft watercolor bleeds to keep the focus on the characters. Centered in the middle of the design, in a beautiful, readable, dark-colored handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Thanks for always feeding us, Lao Lao!\". The overall style is lighthearted, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and a visible paper texture.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "thank-you", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c2973d3ea698342f3d0277869c1bda8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284211.995963, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-edfcd134-fb33-4af7-8e37-889abe38e68d", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5b2f6ce9.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284211.995963, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a young Asian couple, transformed into humorous cartoon characters, standing side-by-side and comically struggling to lift a giant, steaming, oversized bowl of dumplings that is almost as big as them.
