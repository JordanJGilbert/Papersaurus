{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, comic book style illustration, vibrant and saturated colors with bold black outlines and dynamic action lines. The scene features Lao Lao as a pampered queen and Jordan as her devoted royal guard, based on the people in the reference photo.\n\nLao Lao is depicted sitting majestically on an ornate, oversized golden throne with plush velvet cushions. She wears an elegant royal gown and a sparkling crown perched jauntily on her head. With a humorous, smugly satisfied expression, she reclines lazily, her head tilted back as she's about to receive a grape.\n\nKneeling devotedly beside the throne is Jordan, transformed into a royal guard in a ridiculously formal uniform with shiny gold buttons and epaulets. He has a comically earnest and adoring expression as he carefully holds a single, juicy grape up to Lao Lao's mouth. In his other hand, he waves an enormous, fan-like tropical leaf, creating stylized \"whoosh\" lines around it to indicate motion.\n\nThe background is a simple but grand throne room with stone walls and a single arched window showing a bright blue sky. The composition is angled slightly from below to emphasize Queen Lao Lao's royal status.\n\nCentered in the space below the throne, the text \"Happy Birthday, Your Majesty\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, hand-drawn cursive script with a slight comic-book flair. The artwork is flat 2D, perfect for printing."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-5c6d224c2967f389a10b272fb8406fcc"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752432607.1347141, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-1985d67e-cfa5-4879-81c5-3a58a7bbc009", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_e2212098.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752432607.1347141, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, comic book style illustration, vibrant and saturated colors with bold black outlines and dynamic action lines.
