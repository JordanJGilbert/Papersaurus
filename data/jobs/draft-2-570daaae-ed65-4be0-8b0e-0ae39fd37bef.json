{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D comic book style greeting card front, extremely vibrant and dynamic. A super-hero themed action scene on a snowy mountaintop under a bright blue sky.\n\nThe scene features two characters, illustrated versions of Jordan from the photo on the left and Lao Lao from the photo on the right. Jordan is depicted as \"Captain Coder,\" a superhero wearing his dark blue t-shirt from the photo, but now with a dramatic, flowing red cape. He's striking a heroic pose on a snowboard mid-air, a huge grin on his face, launching off a snowy ramp. One hand is outstretched, shooting a beam of binary code (glowing green 1s and 0s) towards the sky.\n\nLao Lao is depicted as his super-partner, \"The Gourmet Guardian,\" wearing her white zip-up jacket from the photo. She is cheering him on from the side of the ramp, holding a pair of oversized chopsticks.\n\nThe snowy landscape is hilariously littered with their favorite foods. Giant pieces of sushi, perfectly marbled wagyu steak, and steaming Chinese takeout boxes are scattered around the mountain like epic obstacles. A massive speech bubble erupts from the center of the action with the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" in a classic, bold, handwritten cursive comic book font.\n\nThe entire image has a high-energy feel, with classic comic book elements like Kirby dots, action lines radiating from the characters, and a bold black outline defining all the elements. The colors are saturated and pop off the page.
