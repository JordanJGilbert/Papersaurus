{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D illustration for a birthday card front cover in a dreamy fantasy anime style. The scene is humorous and lighthearted. In the center, a cartoon illustration of two specific young adults, rendered with whimsical and enchanting fairy-tale qualities.\n\nPerson 1 (Lao Lao): An East Asian woman in her early 20s, with long, straight dark brown hair parted on the side, wearing thin, round metal-framed glasses. She is wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a small, stylized, magical-looking circular logo on the chest. She has a warm, happy smile and her arms are crossed. She is positioned slightly to the left.\n\nPerson 2 (Jordan): A Southeast/East Asian man in his early 20s with short, textured black hair. He stands directly behind the woman, embracing her in a playful hug. He's wearing a tan hoodie and has a wide, cheerful smile.\n\nThe humorous element comes from the surreal, dreamy fantasy background clashing with their casual modern clothing. They are standing in an enchanted forest clearing bathed in soft, magical light. Whimsical, oversized, glowing mushrooms and floating sparkling lily pads surround them. A tiny, mischievous fairy is comically trying to lift Jordan's hoodie with a sparkling magic wand. The background is a soft pastel blend of lavender, mint green, and baby blue, creating a magical atmosphere with detailed, enchanted nature elements.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned safely away from the edges, the greeting text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, colored in a soft, shimmering gold.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-827d2f26234ed98983bfede6994baad2"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278304.2290862, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-9f9ed483-c3e5-4f5b-8e52-e342f2c3f0a5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c3c991fd.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278304.2290862, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D illustration for a birthday card front cover in a dreamy fantasy anime style.
