{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, soft watercolor painting style. A whimsical and humorous illustration of the people from the reference photo, transformed into charming cartoon characters. Jordan is sitting in front of a laptop that has lines of code on the screen, but instead of coding, he's expertly using chopsticks to pick up a piece of perfectly marbled wagyu steak that's levitating out of the screen. Lao Lao is behind him, playfully attempting to snowboard down a giant mountain made of sushi rolls and Chinese takeout boxes. The snowy peaks are made of rice, with nigiri and maki rolls dotting the landscape like trees and rocks. They are both laughing. The entire scene is painted with flowing watercolors, soft edges, and a bright, cheerful palette. Centered in the middle of the design, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" The background is a simple wash of soft blue and white, keeping the focus on the funny, detailed scene. Flat 2D artwork for printing."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555272.0198395, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-63f98966-8e35-4f32-a832-61fd684a7929", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_ab95de55.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555272.0198395, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, soft watercolor painting style.
