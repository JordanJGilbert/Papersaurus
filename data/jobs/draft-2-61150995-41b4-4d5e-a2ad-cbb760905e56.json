{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D comic book art style greeting card front. In a dynamic, action-packed scene, Lao Lao from the photo is depicted as a superhero named \"Boba Girl.\" She is wearing a bright, fun superhero costume inspired by her light blue sweatshirt from the photo, perhaps with a cape and a boba-themed insignia on her chest. She has a joyful, powerful expression as she strikes a heroic pose, holding up a giant, oversized boba tea cup like a trophy. Jordan, from the photo, is depicted in his brown hoodie, cheering her on enthusiastically in the background, possibly giving a thumbs-up. The setting is a stylized, cute beach with vibrant turquoise water, whimsical palm trees that look like giant straws, and sand made of brown sugar crystals. The sky is filled with classic comic book action elements like \"POW!\" and \"ZAP!\" sound effect bubbles.\n\nCentered on the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my SUPER girlfriend, Lao Lao!\" The text is placed within a comic book style speech bubble. The overall composition is explosive with bold colors, thick black outlines, and Ben-Day dots for shading, characteristic of vintage comics."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752447875.5611696, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-61150995-41b4-4d5e-a2ad-cbb760905e56", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5ab022e5.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447875.5611696, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D comic book art style greeting card front.
