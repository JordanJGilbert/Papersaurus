She's wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a circular logo ('ROCKY MO...'), and black pants. She has a warm, smiling expression.\n\nOn the right, a young man of Southeast Asian or East Asian descent, aged 20-25, with short, textured black hair. He is wearing a tan hoodie and dark maroon sweatpants, and has a broad, smiling expression.\n\nThe two are depicted as superheroes in dynamic, mid-action poses, as if bursting onto the scene. They are surrounded by classic comic book visual effects like \"POW!\" and \"ZAP!\" sound effect graphics. The background features a vibrant city skyline with a sunburst pattern and halftone dots. In a large, explosive speech bubble in the center of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday!\" are written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script.
