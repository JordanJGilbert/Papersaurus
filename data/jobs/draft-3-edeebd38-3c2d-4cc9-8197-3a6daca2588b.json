The scene is set in an enchanted, magical forest filled with oversized, glowing mushrooms and whimsical, floating lily pads on a sparkling, pastel-colored stream.\n\nThe characters are cartoon versions of the people in the reference photo. On the left is Lao Lao, a young East Asian woman with long, straight black hair, a warm smile, and gold-rimmed glasses. She is wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt (without any logo) and black pants. On the right is Jordan, a young Southeast Asian man with short, dark, textured hair and a bright smile. He is wearing a tan hoodie and dark maroon pants.\n\nThe humorous and lighthearted moment shows Jordan comically struggling to carry a giant, beautifully decorated birthday cake that is tilting precariously. Lao Lao is laughing joyfully as she tries to help him balance it, one hand on his arm and the other on the cake. The cake itself is a fantasy creation, with glowing frosting and sparkling candy jewels. The background features detailed, soft-focus nature elements like mossy trees with fairy lights, and tiny, glowing sprites fluttering around, creating a magical, enchanting fairy-tale atmosphere with a soft pastel color palette.\n\nCentered on the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person to adventure with, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284663.5977297, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-edeebd38-3c2d-4cc9-8197-3a6daca2588b", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_015161f2.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284663.5977297, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D dreamy fantasy anime-style illustration of a couple, for a birthday card front.
