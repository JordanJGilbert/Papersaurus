{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "2D flat illustration for a greeting card. A humorous and lighthearted botanical beach scene featuring the couple from the reference photo as cartoon characters.\n\nIn the center of the composition, Lao Lao is comically buried in the sand up to her neck, wearing a bright party hat and looking up with a cheerful, slightly mischievous grin. Only her head and neck are visible. Next to her, Jordan is kneeling down, patting the last bit of sand into place with a happy, playful expression. He is wearing his tan hoodie and dark pants from the photo, but with the hood up. From the sand mound where Lao Lao is buried, a signpost whimsically \"grows\" out of the sand like a plant. On the signpost, written in beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\".\n\nThe beach setting is stylized and fun. The sand is a warm beige, and the ocean in the background is a gentle turquoise with simple, cartoonish waves. The sky is a soft, clear blue.\n\nThe scene is framed by a lush botanical border. Large, stylized tropical leaves like monstera and palm fronds in shades of green and teal curve in from the sides, top, and bottom, creating a natural frame around the funny beach scene. A few whimsical, colorful tropical flowers (hibiscus, birds of paradise) are tucked among the leaves. The overall style is clean, modern, and illustrated with a charming, hand-drawn feel."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-51c5fa355604b95677dc32a1f19c876f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752512809.9376578, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-b0d967cd-7a9d-4539-83f5-baadb16f58db", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_502e47bc.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752512809.9376578, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "2D flat illustration for a greeting card.
