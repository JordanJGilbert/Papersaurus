{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting of two cartoon characters, based on the people in reference photo de1c1928-5440-4c39-bc93-15ab7392100e, standing side-by-side. The characters are bursting into laughter, with exaggerated joyful expressions, heads tilted back, and eyes crinkled in amusement. They are celebrating a birthday, surrounded by a chaotic explosion of colorful confetti, a few floating balloons, and maybe a single, precariously balanced party hat on one of their heads. The overall scene is vibrant, energetic, and full of humorous motion. The background is a soft, light-colored wash with organic paint splatters and bleeds, giving it an artistic and lighthearted feel. The artwork is flat 2D for printing, with visible paper texture and artistic brush strokes. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Sammy! Don't worry, we're not old, we're vintage!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sammy", "fromField": "John", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c26762523373d567f4719418701ddee"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752279722.1106067, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-37de1eee-8721-4afc-92f5-e11dff5002d8", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4d2d77f8.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752279722.1106067, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting of two cartoon characters, based on the people in reference photo de1c1928-5440-4c39-bc93-15ab7392100e, standing side-by-side.
