{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D artwork for a greeting card front. A funny and charming watercolor painting of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, transformed into cartoon astronauts floating in outer space. The background is a deep indigo and navy blue galaxy, filled with soft watercolor washes, splatters of white stars, and glowing nebula clouds in shades of pink and turquoise.\n\nLao Lao (person on the left) is depicted as a cartoon astronaut floating on the left side of the card, wearing a whimsical spacesuit with elements from her light blue sweatshirt from the photo. She has a huge, joyful smile and is reaching out with one hand towards a fantastical rocket ship.\n\nJordan (person on the right) is also depicted as a cartoon astronaut floating on the right side, wearing a spacesuit that incorporates the color of his tan hoodie from the photo. He has a wide, happy grin and is playfully trying to catch a floating cupcake with a single candle on it.\n\nBetween them and slightly in the background, a magnificent rocket ship shaped like a three-tiered birthday cake drifts by. The cake-rocket has frosting details, candy-light thrusters, and sprinkles that trail behind it like cosmic dust. The scene is dotted with charming, stylized planets\u2014one that looks like Saturn with a cookie ring, and another small, moon-like planet made of cheese.\n\nThe overall composition is dynamic and full of movement, capturing a zero-gravity scene with a lighthearted, humorous tone. The watercolor style is soft and blended, with visible paint textures and soft edges.\n\nIn the center of the composition, in a clear area, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-800ace4a1f9e9dc9a6e875ec165b8b88"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752424373.556871, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-9fe5906a-1c91-4f61-8729-d42172e8b25c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_99304436.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752424373.556871, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D artwork for a greeting card front.
