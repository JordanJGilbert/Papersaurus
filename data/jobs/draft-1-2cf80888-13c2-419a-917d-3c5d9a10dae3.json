Whimsical botanical illustration, flat 2D style with clean lines and a soft, natural color palette.\n\nThe scene depicts Lao Lao from the reference photo as a cartoon character, sitting majestically on an ornate throne made of woven vines, blooming flowers, and lush green ferns. She has a playful, queenly expression, leaning back comfortably. She is wearing a flowing, elegant dress similar in color to her light blue sweatshirt from the photo.\n\nJordan, from the reference photo, is illustrated as her devoted royal guard, kneeling beside the throne. He is dressed in an outfit that humorously mimics royal attire, but made of natural elements like a leafy tunic and a simple belt. His clothing is in earthy tones, reminiscent of his brown hoodie in the photo. He has a funny, adoring expression as he attentively holds a bunch of plump purple grapes up to her, while in his other hand, he waves a giant, oversized monstera leaf like a fan.\n\nThe entire scene is set against a simple, light cream background. The composition is framed with a delicate border of hanging philodendron vines and small wildflowers, reinforcing the botanical theme.\n\nIn the center of the card, below the main illustration, the text \"Happy Birthday to my Queen\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-5c6d224c2967f389a10b272fb8406fcc"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752432607.831735, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-2cf80888-13c2-419a-917d-3c5d9a10dae3", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_b9f62c03.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752432607.831735, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover.
