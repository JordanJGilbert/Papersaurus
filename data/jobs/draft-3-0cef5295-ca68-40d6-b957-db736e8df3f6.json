{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A full-shot, 2D flat illustration for a birthday card front cover, in the style of a lighthearted watercolor painting. The scene is a sunny beach with gentle ocean waves in the background. In the center, an elderly Asian woman, \"Lao Lao,\" sits majestically on a large throne constructed entirely from mahjong tiles. She is depicted as a cartoon queen, wearing a small, playful crown and a big, happy smile, holding a giant bubble tea with both hands. To her left, stands a cartoon version of a young man with short, slightly tousled black hair, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, captured with a broad, warm, cheerful smile showing very white teeth. To her right, stands a cartoon version of a young woman with long, straight black hair past her shoulders, wearing thin, gold-rimmed circular glasses and a yellow sundress with a red floral pattern, smiling happily and contentedly. The style is soft and flowing, with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. In the center of the scene, in a clear area, the words \"Happy Birthday\" are written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-972b283028750b16c4b1188bb1e09bdb"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752248042.122368, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-0cef5295-ca68-40d6-b957-db736e8df3f6", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_3b246b77.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752248042.122368, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A full-shot, 2D flat illustration for a birthday card front cover, in the style of a lighthearted watercolor painting.
