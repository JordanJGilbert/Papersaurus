In the center, two people are illustrated as cartoon characters based on the reference photo [d2f9644c-4b1e-42f9-8a02-5ed6868fc6b5]. The characters highly resemble the people in the photo, with the same clothing (logos omitted), hairstyles, facial features, body proportions, and relative positions, including glasses if worn. The characters are depicted in a funny, exaggerated pose, perhaps tripping over an invisible line or juggling birthday cupcakes poorly, with frosting splatters. The background is a soft, light-colored watercolor wash with celebratory confetti and streamers painted in a loose, artistic style. In the safe center area, the text \"Happy Birthday, Sarah! Let's pretend we have our lives together.\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script. The entire design is a flat 2D artwork in a watercolor painting style, featuring soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sarah", "fromField": "James", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ed65d0107a99ea743b81f9b1e076cb0f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278820.6974037, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-5e5409e6-8f8b-4ef6-9897-95d9fa779ba8", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4b87d6cb.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278820.6974037, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card for Sarah, humorous and lighthearted.
