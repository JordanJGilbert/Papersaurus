{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card, a humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration of the two specific people from the reference photo 2c13af74-1727-45cd-85e9-a54f470454a7. The man on the left, with his distinct glasses, short dark hair, and wearing his casual polo shirt, is playfully trying to blow out a single, stubbornly lit candle on a tiny cupcake held by the woman. The woman, with her characteristic hairstyle and wearing her patterned top, looks on with a wide, amused grin, holding the cupcake just out of his reach. Their expressions are exaggerated for comedic effect. The background is a clean, off-white with subtle paper texture and soft, abstract watercolor splotches of festive colors like teal and coral. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, readable, and flowing handwritten cursive script. The entire design is a flat 2D artwork in a watercolor painting style, featuring soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-7e325068ca54ef08d03bacbff468c8cb"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752269489.141369, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-d008fe81-7827-4444-969a-a755d6fa12c3", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_eed5d392.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752269489.141369, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card, a humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration of the two specific people from the reference photo 2c13af74-1727-45cd-85e9-a54f470454a7.
