{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, dreamy fantasy art style. The scene is a whimsical, magical birthday celebration set in a pastel-colored dreamscape under a twilight sky with soft, glowing stars and a gentle crescent moon.\n\nIn the center, an illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo is depicted as a regal, slightly comical \"Queen of Everything.\" She sits on a fantastical throne made of giant, fluffy, pastel-colored marshmallows and shimmering moonbeams. She wears an exaggeratedly large, fluffy robe over her sweatshirt from the photo and a small, crooked, sparkling crown, looking joyfully surprised.\n\nAn illustrated version of Jordan from the photo stands beside the throne, acting as her loyal and humorous servant. He is holding a ridiculously large, ornate silver tray. Instead of a royal feast, the tray is piled high with a mountain of comically oversized, steaming dog treats and a single, elegant birthday cake with one glowing candle.\n\nAll around the throne, a chaotic and adorable pack of various cute dogs (like corgis, shibas, poodles, golden retrievers) are playing and frolicking. Some dogs wear tiny party hats, one is attempting to steal a dog treat from the tray, another is sleeping on a floating cloud, and a few are looking up at Lao Lao with adoration.\n\nThe entire scene has a soft, ethereal glow, with magical sparkles and swirling pastel-colored mist floating gently in the air. The background is a simple, dreamy landscape of soft, rolling hills made of candy floss.\n\nIn the open space above the scene, centered, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao\" written in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script with a subtle glowing effect."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a11b02942a7363d16abb46552f17c398"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752450074.9798872, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-23909c42-1f06-4b57-9830-262d8a434e4c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_b5bcc515.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752450074.9798872, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, dreamy fantasy art style.
