{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card. A funny and lighthearted beach scene in a beautiful watercolor art style with soft edges and blended colors.\n\nIn the center, Lao Lao and Jordan are illustrated as cartoon characters based on the reference photo. Lao Lao, in her light blue sweatshirt, is hilariously tangled up in a ridiculously long string of birthday party flags she's trying to hang between two crooked palm trees. She has a playful, slightly exasperated expression as she holds one end of the string. Jordan, in his tan hoodie, stands nearby, laughing heartily while holding a giant, comically oversized piece of birthday cake with one candle on top, offering it to her as if it will solve the decorating disaster.\n\nThe beach setting is whimsical: the sand is dotted with silly seashells wearing tiny party hats, and a couple of cartoon crabs are scurrying by, one carrying a tiny gift box and the other snapping its claws to the beat of an imaginary party song. The ocean in the background is a gentle wash of turquoise and blue, with cheerful, stylized waves. The sky is bright with soft, watercolor clouds.\n\nCentered in the open space above the couple, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script. The overall composition is vibrant, joyful, and full of charming, humorous details.
