{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of a humorous birthday scene for Lao Lao from her boyfriend, Jordan, set against a simple, clean white background with a subtle paper texture. In the center, a highly accurate cartoon version of Lao Lao, an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair, a warm smile, and thin gold-rimmed glasses, is sitting at a small table, looking overjoyed. She is wearing a simple black long-sleeved shirt. In front of her is a massive, comically oversized feast just for her: a giant steaming bowl of Chinese porridge (congee), a ridiculously long banh mi sandwich that stretches across the table, and an enormous cup of boba tea with huge tapioca pearls.\n\nAcross from her, a cartoon version of Jordan, an East Asian man with voluminous, spiky dark brown hair and a big, happy grin, looks on lovingly with a slightly overwhelmed but amused expression. He is wearing a plain maroon t-shirt. He's holding a single tiny candle, presenting it towards the feast as if it's the birthday cake. The overall vibe is playful and adoring, celebrating their shared love for these foods.\n\nThe watercolor style is soft and artistic, with visible brush strokes, gentle color bleeding at the edges, and a light, airy feel.\n\nCentered on the card, below the main illustration, is the greeting in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday, my Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-af382523c5c6f9706b5b3d7417ab2736"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752289013.6103766, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-eb0749c3-108a-4170-b4f1-8c1eacca66f7", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_266c9efd.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752289013.6103766, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of a humorous birthday scene for Lao Lao from her boyfriend, Jordan, set against a simple, clean white background with a subtle paper texture.
