{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover featuring Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, reimagined as comic book superheroes in a dynamic and funny scene. The style is classic comic book art with bold outlines, vibrant colors, Ben-Day dots for shading, and exaggerated action.\n\nThe scene is set on a stylized San Diego beach, with iconic piers and palm trees in the background under a bright blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, \"Boba Girl\" (Lao Lao) and \"Beach Boy\" (Jordan) strike a heroic, back-to-back action pose. Lao Lao, on the left, is illustrated in her blue sweatshirt and black pants. She winks playfully at the viewer while expertly dual-wielding oversized boba tea drinks like weapons, with tapioca pearls flying out like ammunition in a cool, slow-motion effect. Jordan, on the right, is in his brown hoodie and dark pants. He has a confident, heroic smile and is holding a surfboard under one arm, posing as if ready to charge into the waves.\n\nThe entire composition is framed within a dynamic comic book panel. Fun, explosive sound effect graphics like \"BWOOSH!\" and \"POP!\" surround the flying boba pearls. The overall tone is action-packed, silly, and heroic.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, layered over the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my Favorite Superhero, Lao Lao!\" in a beautiful, readable, and slightly playful handwritten cursive script. The text color contrasts brightly against the background for easy readability."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-4dc562fc0f9ca81689b6ecb89e7bbc4a"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752511887.9463975, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-f26b10e4-1763-4cc8-bf4c-35ffd17a0ead", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_a40ff703.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752511887.9463975, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover featuring Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, reimagined as comic book superheroes in a dynamic and funny scene.
