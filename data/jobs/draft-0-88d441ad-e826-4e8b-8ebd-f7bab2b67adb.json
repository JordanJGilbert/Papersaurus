In the center, a slightly grumpy cartoon capybara is wearing a tiny, tilted blue and white striped party hat. The capybara is relaxing in a Japanese yuzu hot spring, with several bright yellow yuzu fruits floating around it in the steaming water. It has a comically serene, \"unimpressed by birthdays\" expression. The background is a soft, minimalist wash of pale blue and sage green, suggesting a tranquil spa setting. Floating in the open space above the capybara, the text \"Hope your birthday is as relaxing as this.\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script. The entire illustration is a flat 2D watercolor painting with soft edges, gentle color bleeds, and a lighthearted, clean aesthetic. art by Quentin Blake, Jean-Jacques Semp\u00e9. masterpiece, whimsical, high detail."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752442595.6415799, "progress": "Generating front Cover (fallback)...", "error": "Failed to generate sections: frontCover", "completedAt": 1752442598.217735}
