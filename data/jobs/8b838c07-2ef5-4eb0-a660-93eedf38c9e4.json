Flat 2D botanical illustration of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, transformed into charming cartoon characters.

Lao Lao is depicted comically struggling to hold up an enormous, ridiculously heavy-looking potted plant, with a strained but laughing expression. Jordan stands beside her with a big, amused grin, playfully flexing one bicep as if offering useless help. The scene is framed by a beautiful archway of flowering vines like wisteria and trailing ivy. The background is a soft, solid pastel color. In the center, below the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite weirdo\" written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The style is lighthearted and humorous, with clean lines, soft textures, and a vibrant, natural color palette. --ar 4:5\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.
