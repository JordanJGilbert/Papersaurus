{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover, flat 2D for printing. Features cartoon illustrated versions of the two specific people from the reference photo with Unique ID d4201037-3d79-44e1-b800-06dad6dbf9a3, capturing their unique features, hair, and clothing styles. The man on the left, with his short dark hair, glasses, and wearing a gray t-shirt, has a comically exaggerated expression of surprise and is struggling to hold a giant, oversized birthday cake that is tilting precariously. The woman on the right, with her long dark hair, is laughing heartily, pointing at the man and the wobbly cake. The scene is full of lighthearted motion and funny energy. In the center of the composition, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script. The entire design is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible artistic brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture background. --ar 4:5\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-7e325068ca54ef08d03bacbff468c8cb"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752269489.3534698, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-b3c25ff6-afc6-47ed-a980-fcf1076480aa", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_01665a4f.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752269489.3534698, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover, flat 2D for printing.
