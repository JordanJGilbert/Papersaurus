{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, flat 2D watercolor painting of a young Asian couple for a birthday card front. The scene features illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo. Lao Lao is a young woman with long, straight dark brown hair, wearing thin-framed round glasses, a light blue sweatshirt (without any text or logo), and black pants. She is smiling sweetly and has her arms crossed. Jordan is a young man with short, dark, textured hair, wearing a tan hoodie (without any logos) and dark maroon pants. He stands behind Lao Lao, smiling broadly, with his arms wrapped around her in a loving back hug. The couple is shown from the waist up. Surrounding them are colorful, exaggerated birthday elements like floating confetti, a few whimsical balloons, and a slice of birthday cake with a single lit candle hovering comically near Jordan's hand as if he's offering it. The entire illustration has a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds in a bright and cheerful color palette.\n\nIn the center of the card, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person to annoy.\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284662.9343677, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-6ff5ba1a-a036-4dd0-a6fa-daff310a90cf", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_fd0600c5.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284662.9343677, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, flat 2D watercolor painting of a young Asian couple for a birthday card front.
