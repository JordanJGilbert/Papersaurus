{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a funny and whimsical birthday card scene set on a quintessential San Diego beach. In the center, cartoon illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are comically attempting to build a giant sandcastle shaped like an enormous boba tea cup, complete with a straw made of driftwood. Lao Lao, wearing her light blue sweatshirt and black pants, is laughing as she pats down sand, nearly getting splashed by a small wave. Jordan, in his brown hoodie and dark pants, is precariously balancing on one foot, trying to place a seashell on top of the \"boba castle\" like a final cherry on top. Instead of sand, the beach is playfully littered with colorful, oversized tapioca pearls. The ocean has gentle, soft blue and seafoam green watercolor waves, and in the distance, the iconic San Diego pier is lightly suggested. The sky is a warm, sunny wash of yellow and orange, reflecting the cheerful mood.\n\nIn the center of the sky area, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script. The overall style is lighthearted and vibrant, with soft, blended watercolor edges and a joyful, chaotic energy."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-4dc562fc0f9ca81689b6ecb89e7bbc4a"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752511885.2034357, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-0c1ac86d-1980-4214-a3ee-324dbe9149a4", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_83c69607.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752511885.2034357, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a funny and whimsical birthday card scene set on a quintessential San Diego beach.
