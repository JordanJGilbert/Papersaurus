In the center, a heartfelt scene featuring cartoon-style characters of Grandpa (in the middle of the reference photo) and a younger Tong Tong (on the right of the reference photo). Grandpa is seated comfortably on a beautiful, large scallop seashell, looking warmly at Tong Tong, who is sitting on his lap and smiling brightly. Grandpa wears his grey turtleneck sweater and pants. Tong Tong wears the red patterned sweater and pants from the photo. The scene is set against a soft, creamy off-white background.\n\nA lush botanical frame arches over the top of the scene, composed of delicate watercolor seaweed, green sea grasses, and sprays of baby's breath. Woven throughout the botanical elements are subtle, artistic nods to Grandpa's interests:\n- Small, detailed illustrations of shrimp, crabs, and fish are nestled among the seaweed.\n- Miniature, decorative Chinese opera masks with intricate linework hang like charms from the botanical stems.\n- A tiny, stylized wooden fishing boat sails gracefully along one of the flowing seaweed fronds.\n\nFloating in the open space in the middle of the card, just above the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\" written in an elegant, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script.
