{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A dynamic and humorous full-view watercolor illustration for a greeting card front. The scene is a fantastical combination of a snowy mountain slope and a giant sushi platter. In the foreground, a cartoon version of Jordan from the reference photo, wearing a plain burgundy t-shirt and a dark grey zip-up jacket, is hilariously attempting to snowboard down a mountain made entirely of white sushi rice. He has a determined yet slightly panicked expression as he balances precariously on his snowboard. Instead of snow, little bits of wasabi and pickled ginger are scattered on the rice mountain. Following closely behind him, a cartoon version of Lao Lao from the reference photo, wearing a light-colored jacket, joyfully surfs down the same rice mountain on a giant shrimp tempura roll, using two oversized chopsticks as ski poles. She is laughing and having a great time, kicking up a spray of rice. The background features stylized watercolor mountains under a soft blue sky, with a few cartoonish salmon nigiri and tuna maki rolls dotting the landscape like trees. In the center of the card, in a beautiful, flowing, dark handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\". The overall style is soft, with bleeding watercolor edges and a lighthearted, whimsical feel.
