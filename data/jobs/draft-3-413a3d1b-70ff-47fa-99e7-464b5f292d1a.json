{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card. A whimsical and humorous dreamy fantasy scene featuring the couple from the reference photo as illustrated characters. The setting is a magical, snowy mountain peak under a soft pastel sky with swirling nebulae and gentle glowing stars.\n\nJordan, the man from the photo, is illustrated wearing his dark blue t-shirt and joyfully snowboarding down a slope made of fluffy white rice instead of snow. He holds oversized chopsticks like ski poles and has a wide, happy expression.\n\nLao Lao, the woman from the photo, is illustrated wearing her white zip-up top and is seated comfortably nearby on a giant, perfectly marbled, magical wagyu steak that floats like a magic carpet. She's laughing as she uses a laptop that has glowing binary code (0s and 1s) gently floating off the screen and into the air around them.\n\nThe landscape is adorned with fantastical elements from their shared interests: Instead of trees, there are giant stalks of broccoli and bok choy growing from the rice mountain. Playful, cartoonish sushi rolls (tuna maki, salmon nigiri) and Chinese dumplings are scattered around the scene like boulders and bushes, some wearing tiny party hats. The air is filled with soft, glowing magical sparkles.\n\nCentered in the middle of the design, the words \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script, rendered in a warm golden color that contrasts nicely with the pastel background.\n\nThe overall artistic style is whimsical, vibrant, and filled with magical, ethereal light, capturing a fun and personal fantasy world. The composition is dynamic and full of playful details, focused on the couple's happy interaction within this surreal, food-filled wonderland."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553898.6717324, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-413a3d1b-70ff-47fa-99e7-464b5f292d1a", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_3fbf2a08.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553898.6717324, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card.
