{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A beautiful and heartfelt watercolor painting for a greeting card front. The scene is set on the deck of a classic wooden Chinese junk boat, gently floating on calm, stylized turquoise waters under a soft, dreamy sky.\n\nIn the center of the boat, a warm and loving cartoon-style illustration of Grandpa, based on the man in the reference photo, is seated comfortably on a low wooden stool. He is depicted from the waist up, wearing a simple grey mock-neck sweater and blue pants as in the photo, and has a gentle, happy expression.\n\nOn his right, a cheerful cartoon version of Tong Tong, based on the child on the right in the reference photo, is sitting close to him, wearing a red sweater and brown pants. Tong Tong is joyfully pointing towards the water, sharing a happy moment with Grandpa.\n\nThe scene is creatively decorated with elements representing Grandpa's interests. Floating gently in the water around the boat are whimsical watercolor illustrations of various seafood items like a friendly crab, a delicate shrimp, and a colorful fish, all smiling. In the background, subtly blended into the soft sky, are the faint, elegant silhouettes of Chinese opera masks with flowing ribbons, adding a touch of cultural artistry.\n\nThe entire illustration is done in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paint bleeds and soft edges, creating a warm, nostalgic, and emotional atmosphere. The color palette is rich with teals, warm browns, soft reds, and gentle greys.\n\nCentered in the middle of the design, below the main subjects, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The text is colored in a dark, warm brown to complement the wooden boat. The composition is clean, focused, and flat 2D for printing."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Grandpa", "fromField": "Tong Tong", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-8aeb0d618355b483f19c973a103cffd6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752515643.2944996, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-f9352332-dd5d-4fae-bbe6-aeb8b7da414f", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_60ce93b9.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752515643.2944996, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A beautiful and heartfelt watercolor painting for a greeting card front.
