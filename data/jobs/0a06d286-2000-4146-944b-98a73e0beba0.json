The scene is a chaotic and funny combination of skiing and boba tea. Lao Lao, the person on the right in the photo, is illustrated wearing a stylish ski jacket and goggles pushed up on her head, skiing downhill with perfect form but looking back over her shoulder with a huge, joyful, laughing expression. Instead of ski poles, she expertly balances two giant, oversized boba milk tea cups, one in each hand, with huge straws sticking out. Jordan, the person on the left in the photo, is illustrated comically tumbling downhill behind her, skis and poles akimbo in a classic cartoon wipeout pose, with a surprised but happy expression on his face. He's also wearing winter ski gear. Boba pearls are scattered comically in the air and on the snowy slope around them, as if they've spilled from their chaotic descent. The background is a soft watercolor wash of a snowy mountain landscape with gentle pine trees and a light blue sky. The entire scene has a bright, lighthearted feel, with soft edges and blended colors characteristic of a watercolor style. Centered in a clear area of the sky above the action, the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. Flat 2D artwork, greeting card composition.", "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card, in a soft watercolor painting style. The background is a clean, off-white with a subtle paper texture. In the top-left corner, a single, stylized boba pearl is painted with soft, blended brown and black watercolor hues, as if it has rolled to a stop, creating a delicate, circular paint bleed around it. The overall design is very sparse, with ample negative space. The bottom-right corner is completely empty. Flat 2D artwork.", "leftInterior": "A subtle and artistic full-bleed background for the left interior of a greeting card, in a beautiful watercolor painting style. The design features a gentle wash of soft, light blue and snowy white, evoking a serene sky or snowy landscape. Scattered artfully across the page, as if tossed in the air, are a few stylized tapioca boba pearls and a handful of delicate pine needles, painted with soft edges and organic paint bleeds. The composition is light and airy, creating a beautiful decorative pattern that complements the front cover without being distracting. No people or text. Flat 2D artwork.", "rightInterior": "A minimalist and elegant background for the right interior of a greeting card, designed to beautifully frame a written message, in a soft watercolor painting style. The majority of the page is a clean, off-white with a subtle paper texture, creating a large, open space for text. A delicate, artistic border adorns the bottom edge, featuring a gentle watercolor wash of light blue and brown, with a few small, scattered pine needles and a single boba pearl nestled into the corner. The decoration is minimal and confined to the bottom, ensuring the focus remains on the message area. Flat 2D artwork.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my favorite Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! I was going to try and combine our two favorite things, but turns out skiing down a mountain while holding two large bubble teas is a recipe for disaster. So instead, how about we just do both separately? I love you more than fresh powder and perfectly chewy pearls combined.\n\nAll my love,\nJordan\""}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "high", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": false, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": false, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f2a797f6db576724bce84b81484f86b8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752416514.8211749, "progress": "Generating all card images in parallel...", "error": "Failed to generate sections: backCover", "completedAt": 1752416614.9697268}
