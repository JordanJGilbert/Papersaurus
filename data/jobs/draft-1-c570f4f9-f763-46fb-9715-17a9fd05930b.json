{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A funny and charming botanical beach scene featuring cartoon illustrated versions of Lao Lao (person on the left in the photo) and Jordan (person on the right). They are on a cute, stylized sandy beach with gentle turquoise waves lapping at the shore.\n\nInstead of regular palm trees, the beach is populated with whimsical \"Boba Trees\" which have lush, monstera-like leaves and trunks made of oversized boba straws. Hanging from the branches are giant, ripe-looking tapioca pearls.\n\nIn the center of the scene, Lao Lao is gleefully attempting to climb one of these boba trees, reaching for a giant tapioca pearl with a huge, happy smile. Jordan stands at the base of the tree, laughing and playfully trying to catch her with outstretched arms in case she falls. Lao Lao is wearing a light blue sweatshirt and dark pants, and Jordan is wearing a tan hoodie and dark pants, consistent with the reference photo. A half-finished, oversized boba milk tea drink sits in the sand nearby.\n\nThe scene is framed by a delicate border of tropical leaves and flowers, like hibiscus and bird of paradise, in a soft watercolor style. The overall art style is clean, with bright, cheerful colors, and a whimsical storybook feel.\n\nIn the center of the composition, in a clear space above the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752447876.106065, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-c570f4f9-f763-46fb-9715-17a9fd05930b", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8ab46905.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447876.106065, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
