{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration for a greeting card front cover. Lao Lao (person on the left in the reference photo) is depicted as a regal, slightly smug queen, lounging playfully on an oversized, ornate golden throne. She wears a magnificent royal gown and a comically large crown perched slightly askew on her head. With a relaxed expression, she leans back into plush velvet cushions. Beside her throne, Jordan (person on the right in the reference photo) is portrayed as a loyal and slightly flustered royal guard. He is dressed in a funny, ill-fitting guard uniform with a big, fuzzy hat. He is kneeling on one knee, diligently feeding a single grape to Queen Lao Lao, who has her mouth open ready to receive it. In his other hand, he holds a gigantic, cartoonish tropical leaf, fanning her dramatically. The scene is set in a whimsical throne room with light-colored stone walls and soft shadows. The entire illustration is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible brush strokes and color washes in pastel tones.\n\nIn the center of the card, below the main illustration, the text \"Happy Birthday to my Queen\" is written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-5c6d224c2967f389a10b272fb8406fcc"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752432606.7972107, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-bd61ade2-02fb-4091-84ad-f9080d7e84d9", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c5fb1d88.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752432606.7972107, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration for a greeting card front cover.
