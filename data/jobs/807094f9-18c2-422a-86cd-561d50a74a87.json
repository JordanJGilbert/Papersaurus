In the foreground, illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are having a sandcastle-building competition gone wrong. Lao Lao, wearing her light blue sweatshirt and black pants, is laughing gleefully, holding a small toy shovel as she triumphantly places a seashell on top of her lopsided, wobbly sandcastle. Jordan, in his brown hoodie and dark pants, is looking on with a playfully exasperated expression, his own sandcastle having just been comically washed away by a small, mischievous wave, leaving only a wet puddle where it stood.\n\nThe beach around them is full of humorous details: a crab wearing a tiny birthday party hat scurries by, carrying a miniature balloon. A goofy-looking seagull is attempting to steal a hotdog from an abandoned beach blanket nearby. The sky is bright blue with fluffy, whimsical clouds, and the ocean has gentle, turquoise waves.\n\nCentered in the middle of the composition, in a clear space above the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.
