In the foreground, illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are having a sandcastle-building competition gone wrong. Lao Lao, wearing her light blue sweatshirt and black pants, is laughing gleefully, holding a small toy shovel as she triumphantly places a seashell on top of her lopsided, wobbly sandcastle. Jordan, in his brown hoodie and dark pants, is looking on with a playfully exasperated expression, his own sandcastle having just been comically washed away by a small, mischievous wave, leaving only a wet puddle where it stood.\n\nThe beach around them is full of humorous details: a crab wearing a tiny birthday party hat scurries by, carrying a miniature balloon. A goofy-looking seagull is attempting to steal a hotdog from an abandoned beach blanket nearby. The sky is bright blue with fluffy, whimsical clouds, and the ocean has gentle, turquoise waves.\n\nCentered in the middle of the composition, in a clear space above the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-51c5fa355604b95677dc32a1f19c876f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752512810.6990867, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-d001e731-7895-4eff-b3bf-4435a1f6dd45", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_827a0bb4.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752512810.6990867, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front cover, beautiful watercolor painting style with soft edges and a lighthearted, funny tone.\n\nThe scene is a comical and chaotic day at a sunny beach.
