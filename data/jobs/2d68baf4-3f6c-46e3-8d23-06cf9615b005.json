{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical full-body watercolor illustration of the couple from the reference photo, reimagined in a humorous and charming birthday scene. Lao Lao, on the left, is wearing a party hat slightly askew and joyfully rides piggyback on Jordan. Jordan, on the right, has an exaggerated, playful expression of exertion as he gives her the piggyback ride. Both are laughing. They are surrounded by a flurry of floating, colorful birthday treats like macarons, cupcakes with oversized sprinkles, and boba tea drinks, all painted with soft, blended watercolor washes. The background is a simple, light pastel wash to keep the focus on the couple. In the center, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script. The entire image has a flat 2D greeting card aesthetic, characterized by soft edges, flowing colors, and a lighthearted, celebratory feel.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.
