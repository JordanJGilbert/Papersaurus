{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Vibrant comic book style anniversary card cover. In the foreground, Lao Lao and Jordan are seated cozily together on a colorful woven blanket on a sandy beach. They are smiling warmly at each other, sharing a loving moment. Jordan has an arm gently around Lao Lao. They are both holding unique boba tea drinks served in polished coconut shells, complete with large boba straws.\n\nThe scene is set against a dramatic sunset, with the sky filled with explosive, saturated colors of orange, pink, and deep purple, rendered with bold comic book flair. The sun dips below the horizon, casting long, dynamic shadows. Gentle waves with thick, dark outlines and Ben-Day dot patterns lap at the shore near the blanket. A small, stylized picnic basket sits on the blanket beside them.\n\nThe entire illustration is rendered with a classic comic book aesthetic: thick, black ink outlines, a vibrant and saturated color palette, and dynamic composition. The style is romantic and action-packed, capturing the epic feeling of their love.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in the sky amidst the sunset colors, is the text \"Happy Anniversary, My Love\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script. The text is positioned to be a focal point without obscuring the couple."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752427478.6544735, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-15dfb7b1-1878-4cc0-9752-85096361c9bd", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_6e37fc42.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752427478.6544735, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Vibrant comic book style anniversary card cover.
