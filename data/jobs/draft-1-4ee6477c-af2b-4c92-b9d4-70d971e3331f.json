An elaborate and whimsical botanical scene that hilariously combines all of Jordan's favorite things.\n\nIn the center, an illustrated version of Jordan from the photo (wearing the navy blue t-shirt) is sitting cross-legged on a snowboard that is cleverly designed to look like a giant piece of marbled wagyu steak. He is laughing and typing on a laptop that has lines of code visible on the screen, but the code is made of tiny sushi roll icons.\n\nAn illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo (wearing the white zippered top and glasses) is playfully popping out from behind a large, decorative Chinese takeout box that sits next to the snowboard. She has a happy, loving expression and is offering Jordan a piece of sushi with chopsticks.\n\nThe entire scene is framed by a lush, beautiful botanical border of stylized monstera leaves, eucalyptus branches, and bamboo stalks. Whimsically integrated into the foliage are floating pieces of nigiri, dumplings, and salmon maki.\n\nThe background is a soft, solid pastel color that makes the main illustration pop.\n\nCentered in the open space below the main characters, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555514.4017022, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-4ee6477c-af2b-4c92-b9d4-70d971e3331f", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_a62c55a9.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555514.4017022, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, clean lines, vibrant modern colors.
