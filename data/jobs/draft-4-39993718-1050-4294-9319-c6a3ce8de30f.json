{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover. The scene features cartoon-style versions of two people, Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo. Lao Lao is a young East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair, wearing thin-rimmed gold glasses. She is smiling, wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt (without any logos) and black pants. Jordan is a young Southeast Asian man with short, dark, textured hair. He has a big, warm smile and is wearing a tan-colored hoodie and dark maroon pants.\n\nThe characters are depicted in a humorous, exaggerated pose. Jordan is behind Lao Lao, attempting to lift her up in a big bear hug, but he's comically struggling, with bent knees, a strained expression, and tiny sweat droplets flying off his head. Lao Lao is laughing joyfully, mid-air, with her arms and legs slightly flailing in a playful manner. They are positioned in the lower two-thirds of the frame. The background is a simple, soft-focus wash of light blues and grays, suggesting the sky and water from the photo, but very minimalist. The entire illustration is done in a beautiful watercolor style with soft, blended colors, visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and subtle paint bleeds along the edges of the characters.\n\nCentered in the open space above the couple is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person to annoy!\" written in a beautiful, readable, dark brown handwritten cursive script.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284545.1253836, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-39993718-1050-4294-9319-c6a3ce8de30f", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_51d2a073.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284545.1253836, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover.
