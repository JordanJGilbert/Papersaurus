{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant watercolor painting for a greeting card front, full of energetic movement. In a playful, dynamic pose, the couple from the photo are illustrated as they joyfully ride a tandem bicycle down a whimsical, confetti-strewn path. Lao Lao is in the front seat, laughing with her head turned slightly back towards Jordan, who is in the back seat, smiling widely and steering. Colorful watercolor balloons are tied to the back of the bike, trailing behind them and floating upwards. Jordan wears a maroon t-shirt and Lao Lao wears a light yellow floral dress. The background is a soft wash of bright, cheerful colors like sky blue, sunny yellow, and mint green, with splashes and splatters of ink to convey energy and fun. The overall style is loose and fluid, with soft edges and blended colors characteristic of watercolor.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating amidst the confetti, the words \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script. The artwork is flat 2D, perfect for printing."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-9e185d0fa28140354ce8303f2995beea"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752434211.5737004, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-2805d849-32d2-47a6-b9dd-aed3fc211b60", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_9c7b40d6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752434211.5737004, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant watercolor painting for a greeting card front, full of energetic movement.
