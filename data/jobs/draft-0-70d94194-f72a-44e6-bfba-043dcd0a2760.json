{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card for Sammy, featuring a watercolor illustration of the two people from the reference photo ec930362-d5fc-4ab5-a657-932dec5252e7. The two are transformed into funny, slightly exaggerated cartoon characters, but they HIGHLY resemble the people in the photo, preserving their exact individual characteristics, clothing (without any text/logos), hairstyles, facial features, and body proportions. They are standing in their same relative positions, hilariously struggling to hold up a giant, oversized, ridiculously wobbly birthday cake that's tilting precariously. The cake has frosting dripping down the sides and a single, comically bent candle on top. The background is a clean, simple wash of soft, festive colors. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday Sammy! Hope it's a piece of cake!\" The entire image is in a flat 2D watercolor painting style with soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sammy", "fromField": "John", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c26762523373d567f4719418701ddee"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752279721.8332312, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-70d94194-f72a-44e6-bfba-043dcd0a2760", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_73e1fe09.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752279721.8332312, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card for Sammy, featuring a watercolor illustration of the two people from the reference photo ec930362-d5fc-4ab5-a657-932dec5252e7.
