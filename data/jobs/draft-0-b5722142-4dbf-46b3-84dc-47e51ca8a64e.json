{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor greeting card front cover for \"Lao Lao\" from \"Jordan\". In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The scene features two cartoon characters. Person 1, Lao Lao, an East Asian woman in her early 20s with long dark straight hair, a side part, and thin-rimmed glasses, is depicted as a queen sitting on an ornate golden throne. She is wearing a royal gown but keeps her happy smiling expression from the reference photo. She is playfully bonking Person 2 on the head with a scepter. Person 2, Jordan, a Southeast/East Asian man in his early 20s with short, slightly messy black hair, is kneeling beside the throne. He is wearing a colorful jester's hat and outfit, maintaining his joyful, big, broad smile from the reference photo. A banner floats above the throne with the words \"Another Year of Ruling\". The entire illustration is in a funny, lighthearted watercolor style with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. Flat 2D artwork for printing. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0 --s 150 --c 5\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-6c0358a354c2bb18b27555986b1546a8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752276481.8541508, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-b5722142-4dbf-46b3-84dc-47e51ca8a64e", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5ab10138.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752276481.8541508, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor greeting card front cover for \"Lao Lao\" from \"Jordan\".
