The sand is a warm golden yellow, the ocean is a mix of turquoise and cerulean blue with soft white wave crests, and the sky is a bright, sunny wash of pale blue and soft white clouds. A few cartoon seagulls fly overhead wearing tiny party hats, and a cheerful cartoon crab scuttles by, also wearing a miniature party hat and carrying a tiny birthday gift wrapped with a bow.\n\nCentered in the sky above them, written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\". The text is rendered in a dark teal color.\n\nThe overall composition is lighthearted, charming, and humorous, focusing on the playful interaction between the couple.
