{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting illustration for a birthday greeting card front, featuring two cartoon characters based on the reference photo [37e14119-ff1f-47ba-a4e1-e72bd3757ec4]. The characters, an older woman and a younger man, are depicted in a funny, lighthearted scene, bursting with laughter while trying to assemble a piece of furniture with exaggeratedly confused expressions and holding tools upside down. They highly resemble the people in the photo, maintaining their exact hairstyles, facial features, clothing (without text/logos), and body proportions. The scene is set against a clean, bright white background, emphasizing the characters. In the center, the text \"Happy Birthday to the Lao Lao who can do it all... eventually!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script. The artwork is a flat 2D design, rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. --ar 5:7 --style raw\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a8e679d5c11513cc9a7d3515cf9cd43a"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752282452.860756, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-cea062d5-06c2-4ab9-a4ff-9e372c0e00c0", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_de4d91ee.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752282452.860756, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting illustration for a birthday greeting card front, featuring two cartoon characters based on the reference photo [37e14119-ff1f-47ba-a4e1-e72bd3757ec4].
