{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A funny and lighthearted watercolor scene featuring cartoon characters of a couple surrounded by their favorite foods. The background is a soft, clean white with subtle paper texture and organic watercolor paint bleeds around the edges.\n\nIn the center, two characters are depicted from the waist up.\nOn the left is Lao Lao, an illustrated East Asian woman with a bright, wide smile. She has long, straight dark brown hair that falls over her shoulders. She wears thin, round, gold-rimmed glasses. Her attire is a simple black long-sleeved shirt.\nOn the right is Jordan, an illustrated Southeast Asian man with a huge, happy grin. He has voluminous, spiky dark brown hair that is backlit with a sun-kissed glow. He wears a plain maroon crewneck t-shirt.\n\nThe humor comes from the scene: Jordan is excitedly holding up a giant, comically oversized banh mi sandwich with both hands, about to take a massive bite. Lao Lao is looking at him with a fond, amused expression, holding a classic boba milk tea in one hand and a steaming bowl of Chinese porridge (congee) in the other, as if presenting her own perfect birthday meal. Little watercolor hearts and steam wisps float around the food items. The entire illustration has a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible brush strokes and gentle color blending.\n\nCentered below the illustration, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite foodie, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-af382523c5c6f9706b5b3d7417ab2736"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752289012.9459572, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-fb965938-742d-4f00-9260-2bb45c298060", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_9b59c0c6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752289012.9459572, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
