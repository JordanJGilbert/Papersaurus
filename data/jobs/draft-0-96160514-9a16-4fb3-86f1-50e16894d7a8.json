{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card, flat 2D illustration. In a vibrant watercolor style with soft edges and beautiful color bleeds, depict a humorous and charming beach scene.\n\nIllustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are the central focus. Lao Lao is playfully trying to build a giant sandcastle shaped like a boba tea drink, complete with a straw made of driftwood and \"tapioca pearls\" made of smooth, dark pebbles. She's laughing, maybe with a little bit of sand on her cheek, looking very happy. Lao Lao is wearing a light blue sweatshirt and black pants.\n\nJordan stands beside her, struggling comically to carry an oversized, comically large boba tea cup that's almost as big as he is. He has a playful, slightly exasperated expression as if the cup is very heavy. Jordan is wearing a tan hoodie and dark-colored pants.\n\nThe setting is a cute, stylized beach with gentle turquoise waves lapping at the shore. The sand is a soft, golden yellow. In the background, there are a few whimsical pastel-colored beach huts and cartoonish palm trees. The sky is a blend of soft blues, pinks, and yellows, suggesting a cheerful, sunny day.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\". The text is placed in a clear area, with the main characters positioned slightly below it."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-b44a7f53afed514292da293c413495d7"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752446208.7847276, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-96160514-9a16-4fb3-86f1-50e16894d7a8", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_e0ad0563.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752446208.7847276, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a greeting card, flat 2D illustration.
