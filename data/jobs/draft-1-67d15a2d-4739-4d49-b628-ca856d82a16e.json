{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, flat 2D botanical illustration of Jordan and Lao Lao as charming cartoon characters, set against a clean, light cream background. The scene is a whimsical and humorous dreamscape of all of Jordan's favorite things.\n\nIn the center, an illustrated version of Jordan from the photo is joyfully riding a snowboard down a gentle slope made of stylized, fluffy white rice. He is wearing the navy t-shirt from the photo. An illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo, wearing her white zip-up jacket, is playfully chasing him down the slope, holding a giant pair of chopsticks with a piece of wagyu steak. Both characters have happy, laughing expressions.\n\nThe \"rice\" slope is bordered by lush botanical elements: wasabi-green bamboo stalks and delicate ginger-pink flowers. Scattered humorously around the scene are floating, illustrated items: playful sushi rolls (tuna, salmon, avocado maki) bounce like snowballs, a Chinese takeout box with noodles peeking out sits at the bottom of the slope like a finish line, and binary code (0s and 1s) is subtly integrated into the botanical leaf patterns.\n\nThe overall style is clean, modern, and lighthearted, combining the fresh botanical feel with the funny, personal details. The color palette is vibrant but natural, featuring greens, pinks, reds of the food, and soft whites.\n\nCentered in the middle of the design, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\""}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553898.2625027, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-67d15a2d-4739-4d49-b628-ca856d82a16e", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5be28a27.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553898.2625027, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, flat 2D botanical illustration of Jordan and Lao Lao as charming cartoon characters, set against a clean, light cream background.
