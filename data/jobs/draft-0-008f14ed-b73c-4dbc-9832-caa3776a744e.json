A humorous and dynamic birthday scene in a vibrant, flowing watercolor style. The composition is a playful \"avalanche\" of Jordan's favorite things.\n\nAt the center, an illustrated cartoon version of Jordan from the reference photo, wearing his dark t-shirt, is depicted snowboarding down a snowy mountain slope. He has a joyful and slightly exaggerated \"whoa!\" expression, arms out for balance. Instead of just snow, he is snowboarding through a whimsical cascade of beautifully rendered items: pieces of sushi (tuna nigiri, salmon rolls), perfectly marbled wagyu steak slices, and classic Chinese takeout boxes with noodles peeking out. These food items are tumbling down the mountain alongside him like a delicious avalanche.\n\nIn the bottom right corner, an illustrated cartoon version of Lao Lao from the reference photo, wearing her white zip-up top, is laughing and cheering him on. She holds up a laptop that displays glowing green lines of code, like a trophy.\n\nThe background is a soft watercolor wash of blues and whites, suggesting a bright snowy day, with paint splatters and soft edges giving it an artistic feel.\n\nCentered in the upper portion of the card, in a beautiful, readable, dark blue handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\"."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555353.6880147, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-008f14ed-b73c-4dbc-9832-caa3776a744e", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_f678ba96.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555353.6880147, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "**Image Reference ID: d3ae13b5-77f5-454d-ac0a-3d46bed4712a**\n\nGreeting card front cover.
