{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "[dbe66375-bfbc-43fd-9004-7bbd3e7ee207] A whimsical and humorous birthday card in a charming flat 2D watercolor style. The scene depicts a chaotic and funny \"birthday parade\" led by a cheerful, illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo, wearing her blue sweatshirt. She is joyfully marching across the bottom of the card. Following her in a comically long line is an illustrated Jordan from the photo, wearing his brown hoodie, looking slightly overwhelmed but smiling as he tries to wrangle five adorable and rambunctious corgis on leashes. The corgis are all in various states of excitement: one is trying to chase its tail, another is jumping up trying to lick Jordan's face, one is pulling forward eagerly, another is sniffing the ground, and the last one is looking back with a playful \"yapping\" expression. The entire scene is set against a clean, soft white background with delicate watercolor splatters of pastel pink, yellow, and blue, giving it a celebratory feel. Centered above the scene in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\". The overall artwork has soft edges and a light, airy feel, emphasizing the funny and lighthearted tone."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a11b02942a7363d16abb46552f17c398"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752450074.5313878, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-524908d0-76ad-4518-9ab8-05d480bcd8f5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_0e8d28ef.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752450074.5313878, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "[dbe66375-bfbc-43fd-9004-7bbd3e7ee207] A whimsical and humorous birthday card in a charming flat 2D watercolor style.
