{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor greeting card featuring a scene in Japan. In the center, a highly-detailed, flat 2D illustrated version of the family from the reference photo is depicted. The characters must highly resemble the people in the photo, with accurate hairstyles, facial features, and body proportions. The man on the far left has short brown hair and is wearing a black jacket over a grey shirt and grey pants. The young man next to him has short, dark, textured hair and is wearing a black and grey bomber jacket with black pants. The woman in the middle has long, dark brown hair and is wearing a dark jacket and dark blue jeans. The woman next to her has long, highlighted brown hair and is wearing a puffy maroon coat and blue jeans. The young woman on the far right has long dark hair and is wearing a black scarf, a black and white sweater, and light blue patterned jeans.\n\nThe family is humorously depicted as giants, towering over a miniature, stylized Tokyo skyline. Instead of buildings, the skyline is made of various oversized sushi rolls and nigiri. The family members are interacting with the sushi-scape in funny ways: one is using chopsticks the size of logs to pick up a tuna nigiri building, another is about to take a bite out of a California roll skyscraper, and another is leaning casually against a towering salmon maki. The overall style is a vibrant watercolor painting with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, delicate paint splatters, and visible paper texture.\n\nIn the center of the card, placed safely away from the edges, is the greeting text in a beautiful, readable, fun handwritten cursive script.\n\nText: \"Hope your trip is rice and easy!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "japan trip", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-98cdd699843ffbfa798f80235df750f3"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752296404.9745617, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-f2a3bf68-ea97-4dc3-b870-9328206b3a0e", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_50f93912.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752296404.9745617, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor greeting card featuring a scene in Japan.
