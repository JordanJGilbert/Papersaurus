{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Comic book style battle scene on a bright, sunny beach. The central focus is a massive, meticulously detailed sandcastle shaped exactly like a classic Chinese food takeout box, complete with a wire handle made of seaweed. Atop the sandcastle's ramparts, two charming cartoon figures, a young man and a young woman, are in dynamic, heroic poses, laughing as they defend their fort. The woman is energetically launching giant, dark brown boba pearls from a catapult made of driftwood. The man is beside her, pointing heroically towards the approaching \"enemy.\"\n\nAttacking the sandcastle from the foreground is a comical army of red crabs of various sizes. Each crab brandishes a pair of wooden chopsticks like a sword or spear, clacking them menacingly. Some crabs are comically tripping over seashells, others are stacked on top of each other to form a crab pyramid. The entire scene is filled with action: boba pearls soar through the air with \"WHOOSH\" and \"SPLAT!\" sound effect bubbles. Crabs are knocked over by the boba cannonballs.\n\nThe composition is dynamic and angled, like a panel from an action comic book. The color palette is bright and saturated with a brilliant blue sky, turquoise water, and golden sand. The entire illustration is rendered in a flat 2D style with bold black outlines, vibrant colors, and subtle halftone dot patterns for shading, capturing a classic comic book aesthetic.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in the sky within a classic comic-style explosion shape, is elegant, handwritten cursive script that reads: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\""}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752445831.094254, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-d84d78b2-4591-4e2b-8eff-8180d1f31167", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_e683e0ff.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752445831.094254, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Comic book style battle scene on a bright, sunny beach.
