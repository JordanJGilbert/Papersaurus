{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous fantasy cartoon scene celebrating a birthday. The central focus is a magnificent, magical air fryer, glowing with an ethereal, pastel rainbow aura. It sits majestically on a fluffy, dream-like cloud. From the open basket of the air fryer, instead of food, streams of glowing binary code (0s and 1s) and whimsical icons representing AI (like little friendly robot heads and thought bubbles with gears) float upwards like magical steam.\n\nSurrounding this magical air fryer are fantastical food elements. A perfectly fried egg with a bright yellow yolk acts as a sun in the sky, radiating gentle light. Below, a landscape is made of fluffy, white rice, forming soft hills. Dotted across the rice hills are tiny, charming cartoon restaurants of various cuisines, each with a warm, inviting glow.\n\nA friendly, cartoon-style robot, representing AI, is shown holding a fork and knife, enthusiastically about to dig into the rice landscape. To the side, another small robot is diligently working on a glowing, floating Rubik's Cube, symbolizing problem-solving. The entire scene is set against a dreamy, soft-focus background of pastel blues, purples, and pinks, with floating, sparkling motes of light and soft cloud formations.\n\nIn the center of the scene, in a clear area, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\". The text is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, rendered in a warm, cream color with a soft, glowing outline to make it pop.\n\nThe overall style is a flat 2D illustration, rich in charming detail, with a humorous, magical, and ethereal feel, perfect for a printed card."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "christina.gilbert@live.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Mom, Dad & Jasmine", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752405271.581756, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-cd7ce3f4-2de3-4a64-ac00-1d4458921273", "prompt": "Generated card for christina.gilbert@live.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_dff935cb.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752405271.581756, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous fantasy cartoon scene celebrating a birthday.
