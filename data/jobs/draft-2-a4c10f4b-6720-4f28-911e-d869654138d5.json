{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, lighthearted, flat 2D watercolor illustration for a birthday card front. The scene features cartoon versions of a young man and woman, meticulously based on the provided photo.\n\nThe woman, Lao Lao, is an East Asian woman with long, straight, dark brown hair parted on the side. She is smiling, showing her teeth, and wears thin, round, gold-rimmed glasses. She is wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt (logo removed). Her arms are crossed in front of her.\n\nThe man, Jordan, is a Southeast Asian man with short, textured black hair. He stands just behind her, slightly to her right, with a big, friendly smile showing his teeth. He is wearing a tan/brown hoodie (logo removed). He is hugging the woman from behind, with his hands visible wrapped around her waist.\n\nThe humorous twist is that both characters are depicted with comically oversized bobble-heads, each head being about 50% larger than their body, exaggerating their happy expressions. The scene is set against a simple, soft-focus watercolor background of muted blues and greys, suggesting a cloudy sky over water, with a simple railing in front of them, all rendered with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds on a textured paper background.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite human!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284599.8249867, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-a4c10f4b-6720-4f28-911e-d869654138d5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c8e805e6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284599.8249867, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, lighthearted, flat 2D watercolor illustration for a birthday card front.
