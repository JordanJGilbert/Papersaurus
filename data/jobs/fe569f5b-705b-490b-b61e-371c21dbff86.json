{"status": "processing", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting style, 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A funny and lighthearted beach scene with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture. In the center, a cartoon version of the woman from the reference photo, an Asian woman in her 20s with long, straight black hair and thin, gold-rimmed circular glasses, is depicted as a queen. She is sitting majestically on a throne made entirely of mahjong tiles, wearing a yellow sundress with a red floral pattern and a small, playful crown. She has a happy and content expression, holding a comically oversized bubble tea with both hands. To her right, a cartoon version of the man from the reference photo, a young Asian man in his 20s with short, tousled black hair, wearing a white t-shirt, is bowing playfully to the queen. He has a broad, warm, cheerful smile with very white teeth. The background is a simple, sunny beach with soft blue water and pale sand. In the center of the scene, in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday\".\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style", "backCover": "A minimalist watercolor painting style, 2D illustration for a greeting card back cover. A single, stylized mahjong tile, specifically the 'Red Dragon' (\u4e2d), painted with soft, flowing red and green watercolor strokes on a visible paper texture background. The design is simple, elegant, and positioned in the upper-left quadrant to leave the rest of the space, especially the bottom-right, clear. The background is a soft, pale sand color with subtle, organic paint bleeds, creating a very light and airy feel. The overall decoration is very minimal, covering about 20% of the panel.", "leftInterior": "A subtle watercolor painting style, 2D illustration for the left interior of a greeting card. The bottom half of the panel features a gentle, artistic composition of elements from the front cover theme. A small cluster of watercolor mahjong tiles is loosely scattered at the bottom left, alongside a few delicate, abstract red floral petals, reminiscent of the sundress pattern. A single, stylized boba pearl is painted nearby. The background is a soft, pale sand texture that transitions into a light, sunny yellow wash towards the top. The artwork is subtle, with soft flowing colors, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, covering about 40% of the panel, creating a beautiful decorative border at the bottom.", "rightInterior": "A minimal watercolor painting style, 2D illustration for the right interior of a greeting card, designed to frame a text message. A very subtle, light blue watercolor wash covers the background, with visible paper texture. In the bottom-right corner, there is a small, simple, artistic detail: a tiny, stylized bubble tea cup with a couple of boba pearls, painted with soft, translucent colors. The decoration is minimal and placed in the corner to ensure maximum space and legibility for the message, covering no more than 20% of the panel. The overall aesthetic is clean, light, and cohesive with the card's theme."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "high", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": false, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": false}, "createdAt": 1752248402.7673328, "progress": "Generating all card images in parallel..."}
