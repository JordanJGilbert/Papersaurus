{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor illustration for a greeting card front. A humorous and lighthearted scene featuring cartoon-style characters of a young couple, Lao Lao and Jordan, who highly resemble the people in the reference photo.\n\nLao Lao is on the left, an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair. She is wearing large, thin-rimmed gold round glasses and has a joyful, wide smile. She is wearing a light yellow sundress with a delicate pink floral pattern.\n\nJordan is on the right, a young man with light tan skin, dark eyes, and a big, toothy grin. He has short, thick, dark brown hair that is slightly messy and windblown on top. He is wearing a plain white t-shirt.\n\nThe humorous scene shows Jordan trying to take a selfie of the two of them, but his arm is comically overextended and shaky, causing the \"camera's\" viewpoint to be a slightly distorted, wide-angle fish-eye perspective. Lao Lao is laughing at his attempt. The background is a simplified, beautiful watercolor wash of a sunny beach and ocean scene, with soft blues for the sky and water, and light tans for the sand, creating a cheerful, bright atmosphere. The overall style is whimsical and endearing, with soft, flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.\n\nIn the center, written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person to be awkward with.\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-9a46db1208779b1f534487b8ba24a9ab"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752346285.6679926, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-5f7e16d3-8096-44f7-9ad5-e5b538ecb081", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_799a6e9f.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752346285.6679926, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor illustration for a greeting card front.
