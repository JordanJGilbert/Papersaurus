{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a heartfelt and nostalgic scene featuring Grandpa and a young Tong Tong from the reference photo, reimagined in a beautiful flat 2D botanical illustration style.\n\nThe two characters are the central focus, seated together just as in the photo. Grandpa has a warm, gentle smile, and Tong Tong on the right has a bright, happy grin. They are wearing the same clothing as in the photo (Grandpa in a grey mock-turtleneck, Tong Tong in a red sweater), but rendered in a soft, illustrated style without any logos.\n\nThey are framed by a lush, magical botanical archway. Woven into the leaves and flowers of the archway are intricate, symbolic elements celebrating Grandpa's life:\n- **Chinese Opera:** Elegant illustrations of traditional Chinese opera masks with ornate headdresses and flowing ribbons are subtly nested among the foliage.\n- **Seafood:** Delicate line drawings of crabs, shrimp, and fish swim through the botanical elements, almost like hidden treasures.\n- **Boats:** At the base of the arch, on either side, gentle waves are depicted, with beautifully illustrated traditional Chinese junk boats sailing peacefully.\n\nThe background is a soft, warm cream color with a hint of texture, like handmade paper. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with rich reds, deep greens, gentle blues, and gold accents on the opera masks and seafood.\n\nCentered in the space above the characters, the words \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\" are written in an elegant, flowing, handwritten cursive script in a dark teal color. The entire composition feels like a cherished memory brought to life with love and artistry."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Grandpa", "fromField": "Tong Tong", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-8aeb0d618355b483f19c973a103cffd6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752515644.6700492, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-17f10a9a-26d3-44ae-b8a4-c1221dd69816", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_155117f2.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752515644.6700492, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a heartfelt and nostalgic scene featuring Grandpa and a young Tong Tong from the reference photo, reimagined in a beautiful flat 2D botanical illustration style.\n\nThe two characters are the central focus, seated together just as in the photo.
