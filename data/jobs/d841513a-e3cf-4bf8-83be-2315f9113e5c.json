{"status": "processing", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card. The scene depicts cartoon versions of the couple from the reference photo, Lao Lao and Jordan, sitting side-by-side in a ridiculously small, wobbly wooden roller coaster cart, as if on a cheap amusement park ride. Their heads are comically oversized for their bodies.\n\nJordan, a young East Asian man with tousled, spiky dark hair and a wide, beaming smile, is holding onto the safety bar with a look of pure, carefree joy. He wears a simple white t-shirt.\n\nBeside him, Lao Lao, a young East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair and thin, gold-rimmed glasses, has a slightly more apprehensive but still happy expression, clinging to the bar with both hands. She wears a yellow halter top with a small pink floral pattern.\n\nThe background is a soft, abstract wash of bright colors suggesting a festive, chaotic amusement park, with blurred light streaks and confetti shapes. The entire illustration is in a flat 2D watercolor style, with visible paper texture, soft color bleeds, and delicate ink outlines.\n\nCentered in the space between and slightly above their heads, the text is written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite rollercoaster partner!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style", "backCover": "A minimalist and elegant back cover for a greeting card. The background is a plain, off-white with a visible watercolor paper texture. In the upper-left corner, there is a very small, delicate abstract splash of watercolor paint, using a soft yellow and pale pink, evoking the color palette of the front cover. The design is sparse and clean, leaving the bottom-right area completely empty for a QR code. The style is flat 2D, with soft color bleeds and an organic feel.", "leftInterior": "A subtle and artistic background for the left interior of a greeting card. The entire panel is a soft, abstract watercolor wash using a festive palette of pastel yellow, pink, and light blue, reminiscent of a blurred amusement park sky. The colors blend seamlessly with organic bleeds and visible paper texture. Scattered sparsely across the top and bottom are delicate, confetti-like shapes and light streaks, painted in the same soft watercolor style. The overall composition is decorative but not overpowering, with no text or central focal point. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting.", "rightInterior": "A minimal and elegant design for the right interior of a greeting card, intended to frame a handwritten message. The background is a clean, off-white watercolor paper texture. A single, delicate watercolor swoosh, mimicking a gentle rollercoaster track, arcs gracefully from the top-left corner down towards the bottom-right. The swoosh uses soft pastel yellow and pink tones. This decorative element is confined to the corners, leaving the central area clear and open for text. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting with artistic brush strokes and soft colors.\n\nDisplay this exact text in elegant, clearly readable handwritten script: \"To my favorite person, Lao Lao,\n\nHappy Birthday! You're aging like a fine wine, whereas I'm aging like milk. Thanks for not leaving me out on the counter. I'm so glad I get to spend another year with you, even if it means I have to share my snacks.\n\nWith all my love,\nJordan\""}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "high", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": false, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": false, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-9a46db1208779b1f534487b8ba24a9ab"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752346425.5413284, "progress": "Generating all card images in parallel..."}
