{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover, featuring two characters based on the reference photo d657455b-ff1c-495f-82fb-1b1a3017e639. The scene is depicted in a beautiful, flat 2D watercolor style with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, and visible paper texture with organic paint bleeds. In the center, a cartoon illustration of an elderly woman with short, wavy gray hair, glasses, a dark blue floral top, and dark pants (Lao Lao) is playfully chasing a younger woman with long dark hair, a grey t-shirt, and dark pants. Lao Lao is animatedly waving a single slipper in the air as if about to jokingly swat the younger woman, who is laughing and looking back over her shoulder as she runs. Confetti and streamers in soft pastel colors float around them. In the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! Thanks for not using the slipper... too often.\" The background is a simple, light wash of soft cream and pale blue watercolor.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a8e679d5c11513cc9a7d3515cf9cd43a"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752282453.3512475, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-dd728a16-3d4b-4fd6-950c-afa0ce8dee1a", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_7c5cf2e8.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752282453.3512475, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover, featuring two characters based on the reference photo d657455b-ff1c-495f-82fb-1b1a3017e639.
