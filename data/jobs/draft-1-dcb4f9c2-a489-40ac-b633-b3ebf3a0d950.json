{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "2D flat illustration for a greeting card front. A humorous and charming beach scene in a botanical style. In the center, cartoon illustrated versions of Lao Lao (from the left of the photo) and Jordan (from the right of the photo) are depicted from the waist up. Lao Lao wears her blue sweatshirt and Jordan wears his tan hoodie. They have joyful, laughing expressions. Instead of building a sandcastle, they are comically trying to bury a giant, oversized birthday cake in the sand. Lao Lao is patting down sand around the base of the multi-tiered cake with a small beach shovel, looking determined and amused. Jordan is playfully pouring a bucket of sand over the top tier of the cake, with sand comically sprinkling down the sides like confetti.\n\nThe background is a soft, pastel-colored beach with gentle, stylized waves. A whimsical, oversized seagull wearing a tiny birthday party hat stands nearby, looking curiously at the cake.\n\nThe entire scene is framed by a delicate, artistic border of tropical botanical elements: watercolor monstera leaves, hibiscus flowers, and swaying palm fronds in soft greens, pinks, and corals. The overall color palette is bright, cheerful, and beachy.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned above the couple, the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The text is easily readable and elegantly integrated into the composition."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "lao lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-10653ca1f257ec5a12f90a680470ad55"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752554952.4294016, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-dcb4f9c2-a489-40ac-b633-b3ebf3a0d950", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_34c6246d.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752554952.4294016, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "2D flat illustration for a greeting card front.
