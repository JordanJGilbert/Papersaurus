{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card for Lao Lao, humorous and lighthearted. A funny, charming cartoon illustration of an elderly Asian woman and a young Asian man, based on the reference photo, in a beautiful watercolor painting style. The characters highly resemble the people in the photo, with the same hairstyles, facial features, body proportions, and clothing (omit any text/logos). The Lao Lao character is playfully and dramatically attempting to lift a very large, comically oversized dumbbell with a strained, funny expression on her face. The young man stands beside her, cheering her on with an encouraging and amused expression, holding a tiny party blower. The background is a soft, minimalist wash of pastel colors with artistic paint splatters and organic bleeds, suggesting a festive but clean setting. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao! You're still the strongest!\". The entire image is flat 2D, with visible paper texture and artistic watercolor brushstrokes. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0 --s 250 --cref 10ed1a71-7de4-421e-be3b-05bdfcf78928 --cw 100\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a8e679d5c11513cc9a7d3515cf9cd43a"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752282453.689189, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-2027895d-ed25-459b-a8f9-dcea41b6458e", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c1a0719a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752282453.689189, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Front cover of a birthday greeting card for Lao Lao, humorous and lighthearted.
