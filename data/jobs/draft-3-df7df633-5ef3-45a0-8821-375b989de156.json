{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a dreamy fantasy beach scene for a birthday card. In the foreground, cartoon versions of Lao Lao (from the left of the reference photo) and Jordan (from the right) are joyfully running along the shoreline. Jordan is playfully chasing Lao Lao, who is laughing over her shoulder, trying to get an elaborate, oversized sandcastle-shaped birthday cake from her. She wears the same style blue sweatshirt as the photo, and he wears the same style brown hoodie. Instead of human footprints, they leave a trail of glowing paw prints in the sand.\n\nThe scene is whimsical and surreal: the ocean waves are made of sparkling, iridescent pastel pink and lavender liquid, and tiny, funny-looking corgis and shiba inus wearing miniature party hats surf on seashells in the gentle waves. The sky is a soft, ethereal blend of twilight colors with whimsical, cloud-shaped dog biscuits floating gently. In the sand, there are scattered seashells that have tiny, glowing birthday candles sticking out of them.\n\nIn the center of the image, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script. The text is colored a soft, shimmering gold to stand out against the fantasy background. The overall style is playful, magical, and humorous, with a soft, ethereal glow."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-dd3813ea41f0bca555dc22f82eccad0b"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752448897.570017, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-df7df633-5ef3-45a0-8821-375b989de156", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_504dbd49.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752448897.570017, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a dreamy fantasy beach scene for a birthday card.
