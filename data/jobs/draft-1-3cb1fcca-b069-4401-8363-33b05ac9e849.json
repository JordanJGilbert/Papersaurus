{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous full-shot watercolor illustration of a family on a \"sushi tour\" of Japan. The scene features five cartoon-style characters, meticulously based on the people in the reference photo.\n\nFrom left to right:\n1.  A smiling man with short brown hair, wearing a black jacket over a black shirt, grey pants, and dark grey sneakers. He joyfully holds a giant pair of chopsticks.\n2.  A young man with short, dark, textured hair, wearing a grey and black bomber jacket, black pants, and white sneakers. He is enthusiastically riding a giant, cartoonish salmon nigiri like a surfboard.\n3.  A woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a black jacket and dark jeans. She is juggling several colorful maki rolls with a look of concentration.\n4.  A smiling woman with long, highlighted brown hair, wearing a long-sleeved burgundy puffer coat, blue jeans, and light blue sneakers. She's carrying a giant, exaggerated shrimp tempura roll over her shoulder like a bazooka.\n5.  A young woman with long dark hair, wearing a black and white sweater under a black vest, a dark scarf, and light wash jeans with a faint pattern. She is balancing a tower of edamame pods on her head.\n\nThe background is a soft, whimsical, watercolor wash of iconic Japanese elements: a faint silhouette of Mount Fuji, gentle cherry blossom branches with pink petals floating down, and a large, red torii gate. The overall vibe is playful and dynamic, with the family depicted as \"sushi ninjas\" on an epic culinary quest.\n\nThe entire image is rendered in a beautiful, flat 2D watercolor style, with soft, blended colors, visible brush strokes, paint splatters, and subtle paper texture throughout.\n\nCentered on the card, in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Hope your trip is rice and easy!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "japan trip", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-98cdd699843ffbfa798f80235df750f3"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752296405.7794604, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-3cb1fcca-b069-4401-8363-33b05ac9e849", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_9cad419a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752296405.7794604, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous full-shot watercolor illustration of a family on a \"sushi tour\" of Japan.
