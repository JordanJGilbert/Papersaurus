{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card front cover for Sammy. Two cartoon people, based on the reference photo, are in a funny and exaggerated pose, looking overwhelmed by a giant, precariously balanced stack of birthday presents that towers over them. The characters highly resemble the people in the photo, wearing the exact same clothing (logos removed), with identical hairstyles, facial features, and body proportions preserved. They are looking up at the teetering tower of gifts with wide, comical eyes and expressions of playful panic. The scene is full of lighthearted energy. Centered on the card is the text \"Happy Birthday Sammy, hope it's heaps of fun!\" in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The style is a flat 2D watercolor painting, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, visible paper texture, and organic paint bleeds. --ar 5:7 --style raw --v 6.0 --s 250 --seed 1234\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sammy", "fromField": "John", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c26762523373d567f4719418701ddee"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752279722.1124585, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-9ee281d2-5253-47f9-b0cf-87011af1c00e", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5bd6c1f9.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752279722.1124585, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card front cover for Sammy.
