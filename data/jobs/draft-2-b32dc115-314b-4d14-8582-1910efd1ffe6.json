The scene is an action-packed, exaggerated winter wonderland on a snowy mountain under a bright blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, Lao Lao, transformed into a comic book character based on the photo, is expertly skiing downhill at high speed. She's in a dynamic pose, leaning into a turn, kicking up a spray of powdery snow. She's laughing with a wide, joyful expression. She is skillfully balancing a huge, overflowing boba milk tea in one hand, with large tapioca pearls frozen mid-air as they splash out of the top. She wears a stylish, brightly colored ski jacket and the same glasses from the photo.\n\nSlightly behind her and to the side, Jordan, also transformed into a comic book character, is comically tumbling down the slope, skis and poles akimbo in a chaotic, tangled mess. He has a look of hilarious panic on his face, eyes wide, as a spilled boba tea flies through the air next to him.\n\nThe background features jagged, snow-covered mountain peaks and a few stylized pine trees. The entire scene has bold black outlines, vibrant, saturated colors (like electric blue, hot pink, and lime green), and uses Ben-Day dots for shading. A large, explosive sound effect bubble, like \"WHUMPF!\" or \"KAPOW!\", is near Jordan to emphasize his crash.\n\nCentered in a clear area of the sky above the action, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f2a797f6db576724bce84b81484f86b8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752413994.0837662, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-b32dc115-314b-4d14-8582-1910efd1ffe6", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_71d942ce.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752413994.0837662, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Dynamic comic book style greeting card front, 2D flat illustration.
