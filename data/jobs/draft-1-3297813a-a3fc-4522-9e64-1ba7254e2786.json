In the center, cartoon illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are sitting close together on a large, soft woven blanket on the sand. Lao Lao is leaning her head happily on Jordan's shoulder, and Jordan has his arm gently around her. They are both smiling sweetly and looking at each other. They are each holding a boba tea served in a rustic coconut shell, complete with a wide bamboo straw. The sun is setting over the calm ocean in the background, casting a warm, golden and pink glow across the sky and water. A few delicate palm fronds and hibiscus flowers frame the top corners of the scene, adding to the botanical, tropical feel.\n\nCentered on the card, below the couple, is the text \"Happy Anniversary, my love\" written in a beautiful, flowing, readable handwritten cursive script in a soft cream color. The overall atmosphere is serene, loving, and deeply personal."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a3a320708e462756adceed204a77ee73"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752427591.3619843, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-3297813a-a3fc-4522-9e64-1ba7254e2786", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_238472c5.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752427591.3619843, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D botanical illustration of an anniversary greeting card.
