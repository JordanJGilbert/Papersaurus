{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical watercolor illustration of a foodie paradise. In the center are cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, highly resembling the people in the reference photo. Lao Lao, on the left, is a young East Asian woman with long, dark brown hair, smiling warmly and wearing thin, round, gold-rimmed glasses and a black top. Jordan, on the right, is a young Southeast Asian man with a big, bright smile and spiky, dark, textured hair, wearing a maroon t-shirt. They are standing behind a table piled high with delicious food. Jordan is humorously attempting to stuff a giant bahn mi into his mouth, while Lao Lao laughs, holding a large cup of boba tea in one hand and a spoon for a steaming bowl of Chinese porridge in the other. Giant, anthropomorphic versions of a boba cup, a bahn mi sandwich, and a bowl of porridge with cartoon faces join the celebration around them, dancing and looking joyful. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds in a palette of warm, cheerful colors. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite snack, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-af382523c5c6f9706b5b3d7417ab2736"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752289012.2863407, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-e59137c4-d1af-4f59-9e0b-f458cd90d558", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_946da8eb.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752289012.2863407, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical watercolor illustration of a foodie paradise.
