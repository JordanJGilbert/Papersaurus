{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, clean lines, vibrant botanical style. A humorous and dynamic scene featuring cartoon illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo. They are posed back-to-back in an action stance on a snowy mountaintop, both with wide, excited grins. Jordan, wearing his navy t-shirt, is holding a snowboard under one arm and a giant pair of chopsticks in the other, expertly balancing a piece of marbled wagyu steak. Lao Lao, wearing her white zip-up top and glasses, playfully aims a pair of chopsticks holding a perfect piece of sushi like a weapon.\n\nThe \"snow\" on the ground is humorously illustrated as a landscape of fluffy white rice. Scattered across this rice landscape are various food items: tiny Chinese takeout boxes sprouting bamboo leaves, nigiri sushi dotting the terrain, and little wagyu steak \"rocks\". In the background, instead of traditional pine trees, there are large, stylized botanical illustrations of wasabi plants and ginger flowers. Floating in the sky are soft clouds made of code, with subtle \"0s\" and \"1s\" forming their shapes.\n\nIn the center of the sky, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, easy-to-read handwritten cursive script. The composition is bright, energetic, and full of personal details, set against a soft sky-blue background."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555354.4530644, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-11313560-f66b-446e-8b96-2d19fcc5af7b", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_1f56e136.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555354.4530644, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, clean lines, vibrant botanical style.
