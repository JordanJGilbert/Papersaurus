{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card. A dreamy fantasy beach scene at sunset. The sky is a magical blend of soft pastel pinks, lavender, and a warm golden glow. Whimsical, soft clouds drift across the sky, and tiny sparkling stars are beginning to appear. The ocean waves are calm and gentle, tinted with the sunset's colors, and have a subtle, magical shimmer.\n\nOn a cozy, oversized woven blanket on the soft white sand, are the cartoon-illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo. Lao Lao is sitting comfortably, leaning back against Jordan, who has his arms wrapped gently around her. They both have sweet, happy smiles and are looking at each other lovingly. Lao Lao is wearing a comfy light blue sweatshirt and Jordan is in a cozy brown hoodie, consistent with their clothing in the photo.\n\nThey are each holding a unique drink: a boba tea served inside a real coconut shell, complete with a wide, whimsical straw. Little magical light motes and sparkles float gently up from the boba teas. Scattered around them on the blanket are a few delicate, glowing sea shells and a small, open picnic basket.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating gracefully in the air between the couple and the viewer, is the text \"Happy Anniversary, my love\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The text is colored a soft, ethereal white with a subtle golden glow to match the magical theme."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a3a320708e462756adceed204a77ee73"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752427592.4622822, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-aec2b3e9-f88b-471c-803e-954bfe58a2ad", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4881e148.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752427592.4622822, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card.
