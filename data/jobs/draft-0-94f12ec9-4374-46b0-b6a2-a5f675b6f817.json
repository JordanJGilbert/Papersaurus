{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor greeting card. On a sunny, cartoonish beach, a dog is having a birthday party for its owner, Lao Lao. The dog is a fluffy, scruffy-looking, happy golden retriever wearing a tiny party hat, clearly meant to represent \"Jordan\". The dog is gleefully using its paws to finish a large, slightly lopsided sandcastle decorated with seashells and a piece of driftwood that says \"HBD Lao Lao\".\n\nIn the center of the scene, Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are recreated as charming watercolor characters. They are depicted sitting on a large beach blanket, mid-laugh, reacting to the dog's antics. Lao Lao, wearing her light blue sweatshirt, has a surprised and amused expression. Jordan, in his tan hoodie, has a wide, joyful smile. They are surrounded by humorous beach party elements: a tipped-over sand bucket, a frisbee, and a half-eaten dog-bone-shaped birthday cake on a paper plate.\n\nThe background shows gentle turquoise waves lapping the shore under a bright blue sky with fluffy watercolor clouds. The overall composition is playful, bright, and full of action.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in the sky above the scene, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, dark blue handwritten cursive script. The art style is soft and whimsical, with bleeding colors and soft edges typical of watercolor painting."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-51c5fa355604b95677dc32a1f19c876f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752517537.330283, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-94f12ec9-4374-46b0-b6a2-a5f675b6f817", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5e22550b.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752517537.330283, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor greeting card.
