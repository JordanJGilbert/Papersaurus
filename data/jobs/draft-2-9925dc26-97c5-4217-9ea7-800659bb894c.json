{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a birthday card front cover for Sarah, in a dreamy fantasy anime style with a humorous and lighthearted tone. In the center, two cartoon-illustrated characters, based on the people in reference photo 02c61015-bc3f-4aa0-9a4a-e0ac299314ac, are depicted with high resemblance, maintaining their exact individual features, hairstyles, body proportions, and relative positions. The person on the left wears a light-colored t-shirt and glasses. The person on the right wears a dark-colored t-shirt. Omit any logos from clothing. The characters are humorously depicted as accidentally casting a spell that has caused a giant, sparkling, multi-layered birthday cake to levitate precariously between them, with glowing frosting drips and enchanted, floating candles. They have comically panicked and surprised expressions on their faces. The background is an enchanted, whimsical forest with oversized, glowing mushrooms, sparkling fireflies, and gently floating flower petals in soft pastel colors like lavender, mint green, and baby pink, creating a magical atmosphere. In the center area, elegant, beautiful, and readable handwritten cursive script text reads: \"Happy Birthday, Sarah! Hope your day is magical (and a little less chaotic than this!)\". The entire scene is vibrant, whimsical, and enchanting, with a fairy-tale quality. --style raw\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sarah", "fromField": "Jacob", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-96c35a0e838981227c1a4f328188b210"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752279026.5589557, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-9925dc26-97c5-4217-9ea7-800659bb894c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5874a319.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752279026.5589557, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a birthday card front cover for Sarah, in a dreamy fantasy anime style with a humorous and lighthearted tone.
