{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, flat 2D botanical illustration of a whimsical mountain scene. In the foreground, cartoon versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo are riding on a giant, detailed snowboard down a snowy slope made of flowing computer code (binary 1s and 0s). Jordan, wearing his navy blue t-shirt, joyfully holds up a piece of perfectly marbled wagyu steak on a fork. Lao Lao, in her white zip-up jacket, has her arm around him and is laughing while holding up a pair of chopsticks with a piece of sushi. They are both wearing oversized snowboarding goggles. The background features stylized snow-capped mountains. Instead of trees, the landscape is dotted with oversized bamboo stalks, some of which are shaped like chopsticks, and lush green botanicals with delicate leaves and vines. Whimsical elements are scattered in the scene: Chinese takeout boxes with noodles peeking out grow like plants from the snow, and sushi rolls (tuna, salmon, California rolls) act as colorful boulders along the snowboard's path. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful with natural greens, whites, and pops of color from the food items. Centered in the sky above the mountains, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script. The style is clean, modern, and lighthearted."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553986.9799845, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-839712cc-7b67-47d5-bd71-19c6190d3a7b", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_34a38d57.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553986.9799845, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, flat 2D botanical illustration of a whimsical mountain scene.
