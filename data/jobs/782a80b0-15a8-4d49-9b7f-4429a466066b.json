In the center, illustrated versions of Jordan (person on the right in photo) and Lao Lao (person on the left in photo) are having a disastrous but joyful baking session. Jordan, wearing his black gown from the photo but with a comically oversized, flour-dusted chef's hat perched crookedly on his head, is laughing hysterically as he juggles a stack of precariously balanced birthday pancakes that are threatening to topple over. Pancake batter is splattered on his gown. Lao Lao, wearing her white dress, stands beside him with a mischievous grin, holding a can of whipped cream and spraying a giant cloud of it into the air, with some landing on Jordan's face. The kitchen is a delightful mess: flour dusts the air, eggs are cracked on the counter with gooey yolks running down, a bowl of colorful sprinkles has been knocked over, scattering everywhere, and a friendly, cartoonish golden retriever is in the foreground, trying to lick a fallen pancake off the floor. The background is a soft wash of cheerful kitchen colors like sunny yellow and mint green. Centered on the card in a clear space is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" in a beautiful, readable, dark brown handwritten cursive script. The overall style is lighthearted and artistic, with soft edges, vibrant color bleeds, and a charming, hand-painted feel.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference.
