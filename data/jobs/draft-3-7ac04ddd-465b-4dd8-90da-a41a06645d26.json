{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, flat 2D vector illustration in a dreamy fantasy art style. In the center, a 2D illustrated version of Lao Lao, the woman from the photo, is depicted as a whimsical magical queen of Boba Land. She is wearing a cute version of her blue sweatshirt from the photo (logo removed) and has a small, glittering crown floating just above her head. She is laughing joyfully as she sits majestically on a grand throne made of swirling, pastel-colored boba tea with giant tapioca pearls as decorative orbs.\n\nBeside the throne, a 2D illustrated version of Jordan, the man from the photo, is shown in a playful pose, wearing his brown hoodie from the photo (logo removed). He is offering a comically large, glowing boba tea drink to the queen with a wide, adoring smile.\n\nThe scene is surrounded by fantastical elements: chubby, happy cartoon dogs with little party hats are floating around like cherubs, some holding tiny boba drinks. The background is a magical, ethereal landscape with a river made of milk tea flowing through rolling hills of matcha green, under a soft lavender and peach sky with fluffy, cloud-like foam. Whimsical boba cup constellations twinkle subtly in the sky.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating gracefully above the main characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao\" written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script. The color palette is soft and dreamy with pastels, iridescent highlights, and magical glowing effects."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f3f3def4095e22da7fb8370623c4f9b1"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752520139.38874, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-7ac04ddd-465b-4dd8-90da-a41a06645d26", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_42c528bd.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752520139.38874, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, flat 2D vector illustration in a dreamy fantasy art style.
