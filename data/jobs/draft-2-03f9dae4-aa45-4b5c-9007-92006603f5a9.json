{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous full-bleed watercolor illustration featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan. The characters are rendered in a charming, flat 2D style with soft, flowing colors and visible paper texture, resembling a watercolor painting.\n\nThe scene is set against a soft, light cream-colored background with subtle watercolor splotches. Jordan, on the right, is illustrated to look like the man in the photo, with his distinct joyful smile, tousled dark hair, and wearing a simple white t-shirt. He is playfully and lovingly presenting Lao Lao with a giant, steaming bowl of Chinese porridge, so large it takes both his hands to hold.\n\nLao Lao, on the left, is an adorable cartoon version of the woman in the photo, capturing her sweet smile, long dark hair, and round glasses. She is wearing the same yellow floral halter dress. Her eyes are wide with delight and she's laughing, reaching out with one hand towards the giant porridge. In her other hand, she is happily holding a tall glass of boba tea, complete with tapioca pearls visible at the bottom.\n\nFloating around them like festive balloons are cute, plump watercolor dumplings with smiling faces, tied with little strings. Some dumplings are bobbing near the top, while others are scattered around the couple, adding to the fun, celebratory atmosphere.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned between the couple and slightly above the porridge bowl, is the greeting text in a beautiful, flowing, dark brown handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday to my Dumpling, Lao Lao\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ff03a8e80d6d29988aaedd519e972e89"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752332872.8700829, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-03f9dae4-aa45-4b5c-9007-92006603f5a9", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_1e356b2a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752332872.8700829, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous full-bleed watercolor illustration featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan.
