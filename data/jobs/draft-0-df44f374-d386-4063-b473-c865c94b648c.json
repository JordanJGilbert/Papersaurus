{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a birthday card, in a whimsical and funny watercolor painting style with soft edges and a bright, cheerful palette.\n\n**Scene:** An exaggerated, chaotic, and funny scene where Jordan is trying to present a giant, beautifully decorated birthday cake to Lao Lao. The cake is comically oversized and slightly lopsided. Lao Lao is laughing with a joyful, surprised expression, holding a boba tea in one hand and trying to fend off two small, excited dogs with the other.\n\n**Characters from Photo:**\n- **Lao Lao:** Illustrated in the style of the photo, wearing her blue sweatshirt and black pants. She is laughing wholeheartedly, her head tilted back slightly, one hand holding up a classic boba tea with tapioca pearls, and her other hand playfully holding back two leaping dogs.\n- **Jordan:** Illustrated in the style of the photo, wearing his tan hoodie and dark pants. He has a look of strained effort mixed with a smile as he struggles to balance the gigantic birthday cake, leaning back to support its weight.\n\n**Creative Details:**\n- **Boba & Dogs Mayhem:** Two small, fluffy, and mischievous dogs (like a Corgi and a Shiba Inu) are joyfully leaping up towards the cake, trying to get a lick of frosting. One dog has its paws on Jordan's leg. Boba tea pearls are playfully illustrated as if they are floating and bouncing around the scene like confetti, adding to the lighthearted chaos.\n- **Background:** A simple, soft watercolor wash background in pastel yellows, pinks, and blues to keep the focus on the characters. Splatters of color and tiny illustrative doodles of paw prints and boba cups are scattered lightly in the background.\n\n**Composition:**\n- The action is centered, with Jordan slightly to the right and Lao Lao to the left. The giant cake is the central focal point. The composition is dynamic and full of movement.\n- **Text:** In the center area, above the main action, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, dark brown handwritten cursive script that is elegant yet playful and easy to read."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f3f3def4095e22da7fb8370623c4f9b1"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752520140.6423404, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-df44f374-d386-4063-b473-c865c94b648c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c5fde010.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752520140.6423404, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a birthday card, in a whimsical and funny watercolor painting style with soft edges and a bright, cheerful palette.\n\n**Scene:** An exaggerated, chaotic, and funny scene where Jordan is trying to present a giant, beautifully decorated birthday cake to Lao Lao.
