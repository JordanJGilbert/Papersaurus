{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front, whimsical botanical illustration style, flat 2D vector art. The scene is a funny and surreal combination of snowboarding and sushi. A stylized cartoon illustration of Jordan from the photo, wearing his gray jacket over a plain maroon t-shirt, is cheerfully snowboarding down a gentle, snowy slope made entirely of fluffy white sushi rice. Instead of trees, the slope is dotted with oversized maki rolls and nigiri pieces (like tuna and salmon) standing upright. Large, beautiful botanical elements like elegant eucalyptus branches, delicate ferns, and monstera leaves in soft greens and teals frame the entire scene, growing up from the bottom and arching over the top, creating a natural border. A cartoon illustration of Lao Lao from the photo, wearing her glasses and a plain light green jacket, is at the bottom of the slope, laughing and holding up a giant pair of chopsticks as if ready to catch him. In the center of the design, floating on a soft watercolor wash, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script. The overall color palette is a mix of soft whites, vibrant sushi colors (pinks, oranges), and lush botanical greens, against a clean off-white background. The expressions on both characters are joyful and lighthearted."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-596dac4070073841468dd18a2ce1be73"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752510376.6235502, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-9e963587-92fd-4339-be25-e03e200283ea", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_ab8619de.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752510376.6235502, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front, whimsical botanical illustration style, flat 2D vector art.
