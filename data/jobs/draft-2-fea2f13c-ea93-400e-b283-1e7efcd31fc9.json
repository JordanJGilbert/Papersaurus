Use these as hints to get a better sense of the subjects and details.\n\n**Front Cover Prompt:**\n\nEpic comic book cover art for a birthday card, dynamic and action-packed scene. Illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo are snowboarding down a steep, snowy mountain made entirely of giant sushi rolls. Jordan, in his maroon t-shirt and grey jacket from the photo, is in the foreground, expertly carving through the snow on his snowboard, kicking up a spray of white powder. He has a determined and joyful \"game face\" expression. Lao Lao, wearing her light-colored jacket and glasses from the photo, is slightly behind him on her own snowboard, laughing gleefully as she tries to catch up. The mountain is a surreal landscape of oversized California rolls, salmon nigiri, and shrimp tempura rolls, with nori-wrapped peaks and wasabi-green trees. In the background, a bright, explosive comic book \"POW!\" bubble adds to the action. Centered in a clear area of the bright blue sky, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a bold, beautiful, and readable handwritten cursive script, colored in a vibrant yellow with a black outline to make it pop. The overall aesthetic is flat 2D art with bold outlines, vibrant Ben-Day dot shading, and a high-energy, humorous feel perfect for a comic book cover."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-596dac4070073841468dd18a2ce1be73"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752510377.1968803, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-fea2f13c-ea93-400e-b283-1e7efcd31fc9", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_7872749f.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752510377.1968803, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "**CROP-A-PALOOZA!** Here are 12 different crops from your original image.
