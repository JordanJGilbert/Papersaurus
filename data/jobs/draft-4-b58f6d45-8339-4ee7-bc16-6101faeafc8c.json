{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A minimalist, humorous, and lighthearted birthday card front cover featuring flat 2D cartoon illustrations of two specific people. The background is a clean, solid off-white, creating ample white space. In the center, the greeting \"happy birthday\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, colored dark grey.\n\nBelow the text are the two characters, depicted from the waist up.\n\nCharacter 1 (the granddaughter, Jordan): A young woman of East Asian descent in her early 20s, with long, straight black hair and thin-rimmed glasses. She is wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a simplified circular logo on the front. She is positioned on the left, slightly in front of the man, smiling warmly.\n\nCharacter 2 (the grandson-in-law): A young man of Southeast Asian or East Asian descent in his early 20s, with short, textured black hair. He is wearing a tan hoodie and is positioned on the right, standing behind the woman with his arms wrapped around her in a hug. He is smiling broadly.\n\nThe illustration style is clean and minimalist, using simple lines and solid color fills with no gradients. Both characters are looking out at the viewer. Floating just above their heads are two small, playfully drawn speech bubbles. The bubble above the woman's head contains a single, perfectly drawn cartoon dumpling. The bubble above the man's head also contains a single, identical cartoon dumpling. The overall composition is balanced, charming, and sophisticatedly simple.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-209671b9a3698d8f64f92ba831f02c6c"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752263515.609015, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-b58f6d45-8339-4ee7-bc16-6101faeafc8c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_f9e1bb77.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752263515.609015, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A minimalist, humorous, and lighthearted birthday card front cover featuring flat 2D cartoon illustrations of two specific people.
