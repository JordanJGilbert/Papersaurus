{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a humorous thank-you card front. Features cartoon-illustrated versions of the young East Asian couple from the photo, who highly resemble their real-life counterparts. The woman, on the left, has long dark hair, glasses, and is smiling, wearing a light blue sweatshirt (logo omitted) and black pants. The man, standing behind her with his arms around her, has short dark hair, is smiling, and wears a tan hoodie and dark maroon pants. They are both looking at the viewer. They are depicted with slightly exaggerated, cute, chibi-style proportions to add to the lighthearted feel. The background is a simplified, artistic watercolor wash of a calm bay with a distant shoreline under a cloudy sky, evoking the scene from the photo. The style uses soft, flowing colors, visible brush strokes, organic paint bleeds, and a subtle paper texture. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Thanks for everything, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "thank-you", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c2973d3ea698342f3d0277869c1bda8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284212.4144893, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-d415b220-f3c9-4594-ad1e-62c00961e961", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_d042c6d8.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284212.4144893, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a humorous thank-you card front.
