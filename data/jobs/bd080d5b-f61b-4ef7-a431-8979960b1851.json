A charming cartoon pig, wearing a jaunty little party hat slightly askew on its head, is gleefully leaping into a giant, messy chocolate birthday cake.

The background is a soft wash of pastel watercolor, with confetti gently floating down. The entire scene is painted in a vibrant, flowing watercolor style with soft edges and beautiful color bleeds. In the center, in a beautiful, readable, elegant cursive script, the words \"Go hog wild, it's your birthday!\" are written.
