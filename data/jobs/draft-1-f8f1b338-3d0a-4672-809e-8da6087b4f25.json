{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A funny and lighthearted botanical-themed birthday scene. In the center, cartoon illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo are snowboarding down a gentle, snowy slope made of fluffy white rice, like a giant sushi roll. Jordan, wearing his navy t-shirt, is slightly ahead on his snowboard, laughing with a joyful expression as he expertly carves down the slope. Lao Lao, in her white zip-up top, snowboards close behind, holding a giant pair of chopsticks and playfully trying to snatch a piece of wagyu steak that's dangling just in front of Jordan from a delicate vine.\n\nThe \"slope\" is whimsically decorated with botanical elements that are actually food items: small clusters of green edamame pods grow like bushes, delicate ginger flowers sprout from the rice, and a small, stylized Chinese takeout box sits jauntily on a mound of snow, acting as a ski jump. In the background, instead of traditional mountains, there's a soft-focus landscape of stylized sushi rolls and a large, steaming bowl of noodles. The sky is a soft, watercolor wash of pastel colors. A gentle arc of green vines frames the top of the scene, with tiny lines of code like \"010101\" subtly integrated into the leaves and stems.\n\nIn the open space in the middle of the card, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, readable, flowing handwritten cursive script. The overall style is playful, detailed, and vibrant, combining botanical illustration with a humorous food and activity-based fantasy."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752554099.5849187, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-f8f1b338-3d0a-4672-809e-8da6087b4f25", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_169187ba.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752554099.5849187, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
