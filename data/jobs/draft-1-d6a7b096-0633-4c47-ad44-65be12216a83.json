{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front cover. The scene is set on a sunny, sandy beach with gentle waves in the background. The central focus is an elaborate sandcastle meticulously sculpted to look exactly like a giant, open Chinese food takeout box. From the top of the sandcastle, a small, playful cannon made of driftwood is firing large, glossy black tapioca boba pearls.\n\nAn army of small, cute red crabs advances towards the sandcastle. Each crab brandishes a pair of wooden chopsticks like a tiny sword and shield. Some boba pearls are scattered on the sand, having 'missed' their targets, with a few crabs comically trying to lift them.\n\nThe entire scene is framed with a lush botanical border of tropical plants like monstera leaves, hibiscus flowers, and swaying palm fronds, seamlessly blending the beach theme with a beautiful, natural art style. The color palette is bright and cheerful, with warm sands, turquoise water, and vibrant greens.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in a clear area of the sky, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The overall style is whimsical, detailed, and cartoon-like, capturing a funny and endearing moment."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752445830.4259455, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-d6a7b096-0633-4c47-ad44-65be12216a83", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c745509a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752445830.4259455, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front cover.
