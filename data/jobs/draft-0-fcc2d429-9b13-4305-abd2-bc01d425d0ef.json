{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover, flat 2D watercolor painting style with flowing colors and soft edges. The scene is a chaotic and funny downhill snowboard race on a snowy mountain under a bright blue sky.\n\nThe two main characters are illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo. Lao Lao, wearing a vibrant snowboard jacket and pants, is in the lead, expertly carving down the slope on her snowboard with a confident, mischievous grin. Snow kicks up playfully behind her board.\n\nSlightly behind her, Jordan is on his own snowboard, but in a comically precarious pose. He's hilariously off-balance, arms flailing, with a wide-eyed, surprised expression as he tries to keep from wiping out. He's holding leashes attached to two very happy and energetic cartoon dogs (e.g., a Golden Retriever and a Corgi) who are gleefully pulling him down the mountain like a sled team, their tongues out and ears flapping in the wind. One dog is wearing a tiny party hat.\n\nThe background features soft watercolor pine trees dusted with snow and gentle slopes. Scattered around the scene are subtle birthday elements, like a few colorful balloons tangled in a tree branch and a birthday banner that seems to have been knocked over in the snow.\n\nCentered on the card, in a clear area of the sky between the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-b849efeb798f6ff34a0179d41fa1f289"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752522646.2220707, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-fcc2d429-9b13-4305-abd2-bc01d425d0ef", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_20aee511.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752522646.2220707, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover, flat 2D watercolor painting style with flowing colors and soft edges.
