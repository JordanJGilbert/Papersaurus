Lao Lao is leaning back against Jordan, who has a loving arm wrapped around her. Both have sweet, happy expressions as they look out towards the ocean. They are each holding a unique drink: a hollowed-out coconut shell filled with boba tea, complete with a wide straw.\n\nThe sunset fills the sky with a beautiful gradient of warm colors\u2014soft pink, vibrant orange, and deep purple\u2014which reflect gently on the calm ocean waves lapping at the shore. A few whimsical details are scattered on the picnic blanket: a small bunch of tropical flowers like hibiscus, and a couple of seashells. The overall composition is intimate and serene, focusing on the couple's quiet moment together.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating softly over the scene, is the text \"Happy Anniversary, my love\" written in a beautiful, flowing handwritten cursive script in a dark cream color.
