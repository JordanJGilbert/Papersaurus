{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card. The scene depicts cartoon versions of the couple from the reference photo, Lao Lao and Jordan, sitting side-by-side in a ridiculously small, wobbly wooden roller coaster cart, as if on a cheap amusement park ride. Their heads are comically oversized for their bodies.\n\nJordan, a young East Asian man with tousled, spiky dark hair and a wide, beaming smile, is holding onto the safety bar with a look of pure, carefree joy. He wears a simple white t-shirt.\n\nBeside him, Lao Lao, a young East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair and thin, gold-rimmed glasses, has a slightly more apprehensive but still happy expression, clinging to the bar with both hands. She wears a yellow halter top with a small pink floral pattern.\n\nThe background is a soft, abstract wash of bright colors suggesting a festive, chaotic amusement park, with blurred light streaks and confetti shapes. The entire illustration is in a flat 2D watercolor style, with visible paper texture, soft color bleeds, and delicate ink outlines.\n\nCentered in the space between and slightly above their heads, the text is written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The text reads: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite rollercoaster partner!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-9a46db1208779b1f534487b8ba24a9ab"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752346285.5455894, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-9bfb9f11-9246-4158-8e45-e1ae93428fa5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_cbefbfd0.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752346285.5455894, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous, lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card.
