In the center, a cartoon illustration of the two people from the reference photo [189944a1-42e1-49cb-bae5-a710e562c465], highly resembling their features, hairstyles, body proportions, and relative positions. They are wearing the same clothing as the photo (logos omitted), and the man is wearing his glasses. They are standing side-by-side, both with comically exaggerated, wide-eyed expressions of shock and awe, looking up at a single, ridiculously oversized birthday candle that is towering over them, emitting a gentle, warm glow. The background is a soft, minimalist wash of celebratory pastel colors like light teal and soft peach, with subtle watercolor splatters and bleeds. Centered below the characters, in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday Sarah! Don't worry, we only got you one candle.\" Flat 2D artwork, artistic brush strokes, paper texture.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sarah", "fromField": "James", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ed65d0107a99ea743b81f9b1e076cb0f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278820.4259927, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-d47a4029-112b-4c5b-879b-849a677030b5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_34529cdc.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278820.4259927, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor birthday card for Sarah.
