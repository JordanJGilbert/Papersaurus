{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a birthday card front cover. A humorous and lighthearted watercolor scene featuring cartoon characters of a young Asian couple, based on the people in the reference photo.\n\nThe woman on the left, \"Lao Lao,\" is an Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair, smiling brightly. She wears thin, round gold-rimmed glasses. She is wearing a light yellow sundress with a delicate pink floral pattern.\n\nThe man on the right, \"Jordan,\" is an Asian man with short, spiky dark hair that is comically exaggerated, as if blown by a strong gust of wind. He has a wide, beaming smile. He is wearing a plain white t-shirt.\n\nBoth characters are drawn from the chest up, posed closely together like they are taking a selfie. Their heads are slightly tilted towards each other. Lao Lao is holding up a giant, oversized birthday cake that is so big it's slightly tilted and looks heavy. The cake is whimsically decorated with colorful frosting, sprinkles, and one single lit candle on top. Jordan is looking at the cake with a look of wide-eyed, hungry amazement, his mouth slightly open as if about to take a bite. Lao Lao looks at the viewer with a knowing, amused smirk, as if she knows he's more excited about the cake than anything else.\n\nThe background is a simple, soft wash of pale blue and light teal watercolor, with subtle paint splatters and bleeds to create a cheerful, artistic feel on a textured paper background.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, below the couple, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person (and my future cake-sharing partner)\" in a beautiful, flowing, dark brown handwritten cursive script.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-9a46db1208779b1f534487b8ba24a9ab"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752346286.2322612, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-42e03ed8-ddbf-46f6-8dc0-03d770e20c1c", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_15995dcf.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752346286.2322612, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a birthday card front cover.
