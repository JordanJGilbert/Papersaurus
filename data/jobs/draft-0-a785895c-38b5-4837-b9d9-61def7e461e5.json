{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant and humorous watercolor painting for a birthday card, celebrating Jordan's favorite things. In the center, a charmingly cartoonish, anthropomorphic air fryer is depicted as a magical wizard's cauldron, glowing with a soft golden light from within. It wears a pointy wizard hat adorned with a small, friendly \"AI\" circuit board pattern. With a flourish, magical steam billows out of the air fryer, forming whimsical shapes in the air: a perfectly fried egg sunny-side-up, fluffy grains of rice, and a floating Rubik's cube mid-solve. The air fryer character has a cheerful, mischievous expression. Surrounding this central scene are floating, soft-edged watercolor illustrations of various delicious foods from different restaurants \u2013 a slice of gourmet pizza, a delicate piece of sushi, and a juicy burger, all looking incredibly appetizing. The entire composition is energetic and fun, with watercolor splatters and drips in bright, cheerful colors like turquoise, orange, and sunny yellow adding to the playful atmosphere. The background is a light, airy wash of pale blue and white. In the center, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\". The style is flat 2D, perfect for a greeting card, with the characteristic soft edges and flowing colors of a watercolor painting."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "christina.gilbert@live.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Mom, Dad & Jasmine", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752405271.1520813, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-a785895c-38b5-4837-b9d9-61def7e461e5", "prompt": "Generated card for christina.gilbert@live.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_98a77d6b.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752405271.1520813, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant and humorous watercolor painting for a birthday card, celebrating Jordan's favorite things.
