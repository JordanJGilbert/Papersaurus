{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a vibrant, funny, and charming birthday scene for a greeting card front. In a beautiful botanical style, create an idyllic beach setting with soft white sand and gentle turquoise waves.\n\nAt the center of the composition, feature cartoon versions of Lao Lao (person on the left in the photo) and Jordan (person on the right). Lao Lao is sitting happily on a large, plush picnic blanket, wearing a summery dress. She's comically surrounded by an exaggerated feast of beautifully illustrated Chinese food: towering stacks of dim sum steamer baskets, a giant noodle bowl she's gleefully pulling noodles from with chopsticks, and various plates of dumplings and spring rolls. She has a wide, joyful smile.\n\nJordan is standing just behind her, playfully presenting her with a comically oversized soup dumpling on a single, tiny platter, as if it's a gourmet birthday cake. He is wearing a casual beach shirt and shorts, and has a loving, amused expression.\n\nThe scene is framed with lush botanical elements that blend seamlessly with the beach theme. Elegant palm fronds and hibiscus flowers in shades of coral and soft pink curve around the top left and bottom right corners of the card. A few whimsical botanical-style crabs and seashells are scattered on the sand near the blanket.\n\nIn the upper center of the card, in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\". The font is a warm, friendly color that complements the botanical elements. The overall vibe is bright, cheerful, and full of personal, funny details."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752447999.2522523, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-f0d255c1-5b3d-4676-8002-f107427b8bcf", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_6ae8c519.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447999.2522523, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of a vibrant, funny, and charming birthday scene for a greeting card front.
