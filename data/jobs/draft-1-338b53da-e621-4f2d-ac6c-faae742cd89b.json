{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of a funny and chaotic birthday feast, featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan. The background has a soft, warm cream color with visible paper texture and gentle watercolor washes.\n\nThe scene depicts an oversized, steaming bowl of Chinese porridge as the centerpiece. Playful, happy little dumplings with smiling faces are either jumping into the porridge like a hot tub or scattered around the table.\n\nOn the left, a cartoon character of Lao Lao, highly resembling the woman in the photo with her long dark hair and gold-rimmed glasses, is wearing her yellow floral halter dress. She's joyfully trying to catch a flying dumpling with a pair of chopsticks, her expression one of pure delight and concentration.\n\nOn the right, a cartoon character of Jordan, closely matching the man in the photo with his dark, slightly messy hair and big smile, is wearing his white t-shirt. He's hilariously struggling, trying to balance two giant, oversized boba tea drinks that are tilting precariously. Tapioca pearls are comically spilling out from the top of the drinks.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is vibrant, full of motion, and loving chaos. The watercolor style is soft and flowing, with artistic brush strokes and organic paint bleeds, giving it a whimsical and personally crafted feel.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, my amazing Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ff03a8e80d6d29988aaedd519e972e89"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752332873.6898987, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-338b53da-e621-4f2d-ac6c-faae742cd89b", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_a29bdd1c.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752332873.6898987, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of a funny and chaotic birthday feast, featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan.
