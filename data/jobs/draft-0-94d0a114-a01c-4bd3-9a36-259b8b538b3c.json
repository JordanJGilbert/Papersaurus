A funny and dynamic scene featuring cartoon illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo. The setting is a snowy mountain peak, but instead of snow, the mountain is made of a giant, perfectly cooked wagyu steak with marbled texture. Jordan, wearing his dark t-shirt and a snowboard helmet, is hilariously snowboarding down the wagyu steak mountain, holding a pair of giant chopsticks instead of ski poles, a look of joyful concentration on his face. Lao Lao, in her white zip-up top, is at the base of the mountain, laughing as she catches falling food items in a Chinese takeout box. The \"snow\" being kicked up by Jordan's snowboard is a spray of sushi rolls (tuna maki, california rolls), and dumplings. In the background, instead of trees, there are stylized lines of glowing green computer code rising into the sky. The overall style is soft-edged watercolor with a bright, cheerful palette and visible paint bleed effects.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in a clear area, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553897.8321881, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-94d0a114-a01c-4bd3-9a36-259b8b538b3c", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_83b2890c.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553897.8321881, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor illustration for a greeting card front.
