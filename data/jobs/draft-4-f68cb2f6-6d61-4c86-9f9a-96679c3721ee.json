{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor birthday card front for Lao Lao, humorous and lighthearted. In the center, cartoon illustrations of an elderly woman (Lao Lao) and a young man, based on the reference photo df06d6ec-5500-46ce-8512-489109f7f6a6. Lao Lao is on the left, smiling mischievously with her short, dark, neatly styled hair and glasses. She wears her light-colored, patterned short-sleeve top. The young man is on the right, with his short dark hair, glasses, and slight smile, wearing his dark short-sleeve polo shirt. Both characters are drawn from the waist up, highly resembling the people in the photo. Lao Lao is playfully trying to steal a bite from a giant, comically oversized longevity peach bun (shoutao) that the young man is holding. They are surrounded by a soft, celebratory splash of pastel watercolor background in shades of pink, yellow, and light blue, with artistic paint splatters. Centered between the characters and the bottom edge, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, dark brown handwritten cursive script. The entire image has a watercolor paper texture, with soft flowing colors, visible brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds.
