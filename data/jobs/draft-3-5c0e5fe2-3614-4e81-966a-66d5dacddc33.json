{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, dreamy fantasy art style. A young child, Tong Tong from the photo, sits on the lap of their Grandpa, also from the photo, both illustrated as cartoon characters. They are together in a whimsical, stylized Chinese junk boat floating on a magical, swirling sea of twilight blues and purples. Grandpa has a gentle, loving expression, with one arm protectively around Tong Tong. Tong Tong looks up at Grandpa with a happy, adoring smile.\n\nThe sky is a soft, ethereal blend of watercolors, with glowing, stylized Chinese opera masks floating gently like clouds or constellations. These masks are intricately detailed with beautiful, pearlescent colors. Luminescent, fantastical sea creatures (crabs, shrimp, fish) made of light swim alongside the boat, leaving trails of soft glitter in the water. The boat itself is adorned with subtle, glowing lanterns that cast a warm, comforting light on the scene.\n\nIn the center of the image, written in a beautiful, elegant, and readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\". The overall tone is heartfelt, magical, and deeply personal. The composition is centered, warm, and emotionally resonant."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Grandpa", "fromField": "Tong Tong", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-8aeb0d618355b483f19c973a103cffd6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752515641.7039063, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-5c0e5fe2-3614-4e81-966a-66d5dacddc33", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_ec53cbdd.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752515641.7039063, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card, dreamy fantasy art style.
