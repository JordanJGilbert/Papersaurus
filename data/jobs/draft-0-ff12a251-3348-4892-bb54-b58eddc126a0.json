{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front, whimsical watercolor style with soft edges and flowing colors.\n\n**Scene:** A humorous and bright beach scene. Lao Lao (person on the left in photo) and Jordan (person on the right in photo) are sitting on a sandy beach, using a colorful surfboard laid flat on the sand as their picnic table. They are joyfully eating dim sum together, laughing and looking at each other. Lao Lao is wearing a light blue sweatshirt and Jordan is wearing a tan hoodie, consistent with their photo.\n\n**Details:**\n-   The surfboard is covered with an array of dim sum in open bamboo steamers: siu mai, har gow, and fluffy char siu bao. There are also a couple of cute egg tarts.\n-   Surrounding them are several curious and funny seagulls waddling on the sand. Each seagull is wearing a ridiculously tiny, slightly askew white chef's hat. One ambitious seagull is trying to peek into a steamer basket.\n-   In the background, gentle turquoise ocean waves lap the shore under a sunny sky with soft, wispy clouds. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful with blues, tans, and warm food colors.\n-   Lao Lao is holding a dumpling with chopsticks, smiling happily at Jordan. Jordan is mid-laugh, gesturing towards one of the chef-hat-wearing seagulls.\n\n**Text:**\n-   **Content:** \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\"\n-   **Style:** Positioned in the center of the card. The text is rendered in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, colored in a deep, complementary blue."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-1a06b398ae2d4ad3d5fedb9bf7acc9b1"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752425859.1345816, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-ff12a251-3348-4892-bb54-b58eddc126a0", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_0a4ef34e.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752425859.1345816, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front, whimsical watercolor style with soft edges and flowing colors.\n\n**Scene:** A humorous and bright beach scene.
