{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front for Sammy. In the center, two cartoon-illustrated people based on the reference photo [2eae9431-fcd8-4528-b3c7-fe746611032c], depicted from the waist up. They are mid-laugh, looking at each other with joyful expressions, their heads tilted slightly. The characters must highly resemble the people in the photo, preserving their exact individual features, hairstyles, body proportions, and relative positions. They wear the same clothing as in the photo, but with any logos or text omitted. In the empty space between them, a single, slightly lopsided birthday cake with one lit candle floats comically. Surrounding the characters are whimsical, colorful watercolor splotches and splashes of paint in bright, celebratory colors like teal, magenta, and sunny yellow. In the safe center area, written in a beautiful, readable, and slightly playful handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Sammy! Don't worry, age is just a number... a really, really high one.\" The entire design is a flat 2D artwork in a watercolor painting style, featuring soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges of the illustration.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sammy", "fromField": "John", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c26762523373d567f4719418701ddee"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752279722.4941273, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-66e0260d-fae7-48bb-9a06-462df7cbf380", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4786a7da.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752279722.4941273, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted birthday card front for Sammy.
