{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Full-shot, front view of a humorous and heartwarming birthday scene, rendered in a flat 2D watercolor style.\n\nThe central focus is cartoon-illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo. Lao Lao is on the left, an Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair, smiling warmly and wearing large, thin gold-rimmed glasses. She's dressed in the light yellow halter top with a pink floral pattern from the photo. Jordan is on the right, a young man with dark, spiky, and slightly messy hair, a big smile, and is wearing the plain white t-shirt from the photo. Both characters should highly resemble the people in the photograph, capturing their joyful expressions.\n\nThey are sitting at a small table, having a feast of their favorite foods. In front of Lao Lao is a large, steaming bowl of chinese porridge (congee), and she's holding chopsticks with a big, plump dumpling, looking ecstatic. In front of Jordan is a tall, classic boba tea with dark tapioca pearls. He is attempting to \"cheers\" her dumpling with his boba straw, looking playfully at her. A few more steaming dumplings are in a bamboo steamer basket on the table between them. The background is a simple, soft wash of light, cheerful watercolor tones, with subtle paper texture and artistic paint splatters to enhance the hand-painted feel.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned above the characters' heads, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my best-tea, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ff03a8e80d6d29988aaedd519e972e89"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752332873.1864567, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-2085ba08-3dca-4b7d-8d5d-03e7b7fd0acf", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c2990ed9.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752332873.1864567, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Full-shot, front view of a humorous and heartwarming birthday scene, rendered in a flat 2D watercolor style.\n\nThe central focus is cartoon-illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the reference photo.
