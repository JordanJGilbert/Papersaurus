{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical watercolor birthday card illustration. In the center, a charming cartoon couple is playfully snowboarding down a giant, exaggerated wave made entirely of sushi. The wave is composed of colorful maki rolls, nigiri with salmon and tuna, and shrimp tempura rolls, all rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style. The couple is depicted mid-action on their snowboards, laughing joyously. He is slightly ahead, looking back with a wide, happy grin, and she is right behind him, her arms outstretched for balance with a playful, excited expression. Splashes of soy sauce and wasabi, painted like watercolor splatters, fly up from their boards instead of snow. The background is a simple, soft pastel wash of light blue and white, suggesting a snowy mountain sky, but with abstract, dreamy clouds. In the center of the scene, in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\".
