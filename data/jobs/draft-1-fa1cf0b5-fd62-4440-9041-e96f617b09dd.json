{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front. The scene is a stylized, whimsical beach paradise made of boba tea elements. Instead of sand, the ground is a creamy, light-brown tapioca field dotted with large, dark brown boba pearls. Gentle, milky tea waves with frothy white tops lap at the shore. In the background, instead of palm trees, there are giant, vibrant green mint sprigs and oversized, lush monstera leaves creating a botanical canopy. Floating in the sky are soft, fluffy clouds shaped like tapioca pearls.\n\nIn the center of this boba wonderland, a cartoon-style figure of a woman sits on a giant, oversized lemon slice as if it's a beach towel. She is depicted in a relaxed and funny pose, casually sipping from a huge boba tea cup with an oversized straw, looking blissfully happy. The scene is full of lighthearted charm and vibrant, natural colors.\n\nIn the open space above the scene, centered, is the greeting text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\" written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The style is whimsical, artistic, and deeply personal."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752447321.8263352, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-fa1cf0b5-fd62-4440-9041-e96f617b09dd", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_bba26329.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447321.8263352, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front.
