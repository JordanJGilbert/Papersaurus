{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card front. The scene features two people, Lao Lao and Jordan, transformed into cartoon/illustrated characters that highly resemble their appearance in the reference photos, including their exact clothing (without text/logos), hairstyles, facial features, and body proportions.\n\nLao Lao is joyfully holding a large, steaming dim sum basket overflowing with cartoonish, smiling shumai and har gow. Jordan is standing next to her, playfully trying to sneak a dumpling from the basket with a pair of oversized chopsticks, a mischievous grin on their face. They are both looking at each other with warm, laughing expressions. The background is a soft, abstract wash of pastel colors, suggesting a cheerful atmosphere without specific details.\n\nThe entire illustration is rendered in a beautiful, flat 2D watercolor style with soft, flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges.\n\nCentered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-4e8fd38a8183241a80149432346ebf03"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752283323.3306773, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-4692b3c0-c097-4f35-b981-c1804e06adc0", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_d84d5a22.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752283323.3306773, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card front.
