{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A dynamic comic book style illustration for a greeting card front cover. The scene features cartoon versions of two specific people based on the reference photo (UID: 91834033-3f8e-480d-9384-dc9af5181a02), capturing a humorous and energetic moment.\n\n**Person 1 (Lauren):** A young East Asian woman in her early 20s, illustrated in a dynamic superhero pose, thrusting one fist forward towards the viewer with a confident, happy smile. She has long, straight black hair parted in the middle and wears thin-rimmed, round glasses. She's dressed in a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a circular 'ROCKY MO... RIDGE' graphic and black pants. A starburst-shaped speech bubble originates from her, exclaiming \"IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!\" in bold comic book font.\n\n**Person 2 (Josue):** A young East Asian or Southeast Asian man in his early 20s, illustrated with a big, happy, slightly overwhelmed smile, standing just behind Lauren. He is being comically knocked back slightly by the force of her \"birthday power.\" Action lines emanate from Lauren towards him. He has short, tousled black hair and is wearing a tan hoodie and dark maroon sweatpants with a white side stripe. A smaller, jagged speech bubble next to him contains a single, large exclamation point \"!\".\n\n**Background & Style:** The background is a vibrant explosion of comic book elements, featuring a large, bright yellow sunburst pattern with radial speed lines. A subtle halftone dot pattern in a contrasting color (like cyan or magenta) overlays parts of the background. The overall art style is flat 2D with bold, black outlines, vibrant, saturated colors, and a high-energy feel.\n\n**Text:** In the center of the illustration, layered over the characters but clearly readable, the phrase \"Happy Birthday\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The text is white with a thin black drop shadow to make it pop against the colorful background. It is positioned safely away from the top and bottom edges.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lauren", "fromField": "Josue", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ed8587de1e08c160ffd0cde4c053ffbc"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752264885.9701397, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-ecf12568-aabd-4d41-b153-1877323fa9a5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4c512035.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752264885.9701397, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A dynamic comic book style illustration for a greeting card front cover.
