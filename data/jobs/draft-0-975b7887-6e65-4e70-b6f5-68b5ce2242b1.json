{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous birthday greeting card front cover, flat 2D watercolor painting of a chaotic and funny kitchen scene. In the center, illustrated versions of Jordan (person on the right in photo) and Lao Lao (person on the left in photo) are having a disastrous but joyful baking session. Jordan, wearing his black gown from the photo but with a comically oversized, flour-dusted chef's hat perched crookedly on his head, is laughing hysterically as he juggles a stack of precariously balanced birthday pancakes that are threatening to topple over. Pancake batter is splattered on his gown. Lao Lao, wearing her white dress, stands beside him with a mischievous grin, holding a can of whipped cream and spraying a giant cloud of it into the air, with some landing on Jordan's face. The kitchen is a delightful mess: flour dusts the air, eggs are cracked on the counter with gooey yolks running down, a bowl of colorful sprinkles has been knocked over, scattering everywhere, and a friendly, cartoonish golden retriever is in the foreground, trying to lick a fallen pancake off the floor. The background is a soft wash of cheerful kitchen colors like sunny yellow and mint green. Centered on the card in a clear space is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" in a beautiful, readable, dark brown handwritten cursive script. The overall style is lighthearted and artistic, with soft edges, vibrant color bleeds, and a charming, hand-painted feel."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Craig", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-03bca1782f337d20c9df9f264ad7761b"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752538376.4224918, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-975b7887-6e65-4e70-b6f5-68b5ce2242b1", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_2d5f90b6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752538376.4224918, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous birthday greeting card front cover, flat 2D watercolor painting of a chaotic and funny kitchen scene.
