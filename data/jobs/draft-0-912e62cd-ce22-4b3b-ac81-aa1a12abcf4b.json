The central focus is a cartoon illustration of two specific people. On the left is Lao Lao, a young woman of East Asian descent in her early 20s with long, straight dark brown hair parted on the side, wearing thin round metal-framed glasses, and a light blue crewneck sweatshirt with a circular \"ROCKY MO...IDGE\" logo. She has a warm, happy smile with her arms crossed. Behind her and embracing her is Jordan, a young man of Southeast Asian descent in his early 20s with short, textured black hair. He wears a tan hoodie and has a wide, cheerful, and very happy smile. The background is a simple, light wash of pastel colors with whimsical watercolor splatters and drips in bright, festive hues like yellow, pink, and teal, giving it a celebratory and lighthearted feel. Centered in the middle of the card, written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to the best Lao Lao!\".\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-827d2f26234ed98983bfede6994baad2"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278302.7106159, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-912e62cd-ce22-4b3b-ac81-aa1a12abcf4b", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_1cfef27a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278302.7106159, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor painting of a humorous birthday card scene, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds.
