{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A beautiful and sentimental watercolor illustration for a greeting card front. In the center, an illustrated version of Grandpa from the reference photo is sitting on a simple wooden stool on a pier, looking warmly towards Tong Tong. Tong Tong, as seen on the right in the photo, is a young child, standing next to him and joyfully presenting him with a large, beautifully drawn crab. Their clothing is inspired by the photo, but without any text or logos. The scene is set against a serene harbor at sunset. The background features soft, blended watercolor washes of orange, pink, and light blue. A traditional wooden Chinese boat bobs gently on the calm water in the distance. Whimsical, light watercolor illustrations of Chinese opera masks and various seashells are subtly integrated into the sky like soft clouds or constellations, celebrating his interests in a dreamlike way. The overall atmosphere is full of warmth, love, and cherished memories. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\". The art style is flat 2D, with soft edges and flowing colors typical of watercolor painting."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Grandpa", "fromField": "Tong Tong", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-8aeb0d618355b483f19c973a103cffd6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752513914.1581442, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-3e52f599-798d-4cfc-93fd-188150f0057c", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5c57d02d.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752513914.1581442, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A beautiful and sentimental watercolor illustration for a greeting card front.
