{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous birthday card front cover, flat 2D illustration in a flowing watercolor style with soft edges. An energetic and chaotic scene set against a snowy mountain backdrop, stylized with soft washes of blue and white. In the center, cartoon illustrated versions of Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo [fad5d29c-9bdf-49a0-8663-fb0907eb6d99] are comically attempting to snowboard together on a single, oversized snowboard. Jordan, wearing his dark t-shirt, is trying to balance while typing on a floating, semi-transparent laptop that has binary code (0s and 1s) trailing behind it like a ribbon. Lao Lao, in her white zip-up jacket, is laughing and holding onto his arm, trying to steer with a giant pair of chopsticks. Instead of snow, they are gliding down a river of food: beautifully painted watercolor illustrations of sushi rolls, perfectly seared wagyu steak slices, and Chinese dumplings are scattered all around them, creating a playful, delicious avalanche. The entire scene is dynamic, with lighthearted color splatters adding to the sense of fun and movement. Centered on the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\". Clean white background framing the watercolor illustration."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553987.7990966, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-3366a9f2-13eb-402a-a07c-885dc6a97a23", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_911d50ce.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553987.7990966, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous birthday card front cover, flat 2D illustration in a flowing watercolor style with soft edges.
