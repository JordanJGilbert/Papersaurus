The centerpiece is a magnificent sandcastle meticulously sculpted to look exactly like a giant, classic Chinese food takeout box, complete with the wire handle and pagoda logo. This sandcastle fort is under a playful siege. Perched atop the sandcastle walls, two charming cartoon figures representing a young couple (Lao Lao and Jordan) are laughing as they defend their fort. They are using oversized spoons to catapult giant, glossy black tapioca boba pearls towards the attackers.\n\nThe attacking army is a comical legion of bright red crabs scuttling across the sand. Each crab brandishes a pair of wooden chopsticks like a sword and shield, looking determined but silly. Some boba pearls have already landed, creating funny splashes in the sand.\n\nThe setting is a beautiful, sun-drenched beach with gentle turquoise waves lapping at the shore in the background. The sky is a soft, ethereal pastel gradient of pink and orange, with fluffy, dream-like clouds. The sunlight casts a warm, magical glow over the entire scene, making the sand sparkle. Scattered around the base of the sandcastle are colorful seashells and little pools of seawater that reflect the sky.\n\nThe overall illustration style is flat 2D vector art, perfect for printing, with clean lines, soft textures, and a whimsical, storybook quality.\n\nCentered on the image, in a clear space in the sky above the sandcastle, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752445830.511734, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-452cfe95-3ea0-4fbe-9c4b-22ca83daf560", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8bdf7fae.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752445830.511734, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant and humorous fantasy beach scene, in a dreamy, magical art style.
