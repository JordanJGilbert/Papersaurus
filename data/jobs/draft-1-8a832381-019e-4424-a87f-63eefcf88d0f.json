{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a humorous birthday card front. The scene features cartoon-illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo, set against a simple, light-wash watercolor background.\n\nLao Lao, an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair and thin, gold-rimmed glasses, is in the foreground. She's wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt and has a comically exaggerated expression of mock-annoyance or playful struggle.\n\nBehind her, Jordan, an East Asian man with short, dark, textured hair, is giving her a giant bear hug. He is wearing a tan hoodie and has a huge, beaming, cheerful grin on his face, clearly delighted. The hug is so enthusiastic that it's slightly squishing Lao Lao, creating a funny, lighthearted scene that looks like he's joyfully overwhelming her with affection. Their clothing (omitting logos) and physical appearances highly resemble the people in the photo.\n\nThe entire illustration is done in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and soft color bleeds, giving it a beautiful and charming feel.\n\nCentered in a clear space above the couple, the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite person to annoy\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284599.737747, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-8a832381-019e-4424-a87f-63eefcf88d0f", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_73d78767.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284599.737747, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a humorous birthday card front.
