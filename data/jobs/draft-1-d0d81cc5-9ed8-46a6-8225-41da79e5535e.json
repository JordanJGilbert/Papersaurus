The scene features a cartoon snowboarder character in mid-air, joyfully doing a trick. He's wearing a winter beanie and snowboard gear. Instead of a regular snowboard, he is hilariously riding a giant, oversized sushi roll\u2014specifically a detailed California roll with visible avocado, cucumber, and imitation crab, all wrapped in nori and rice. Light, fluffy snow kicks up from the sushi-board. The background is a beautiful, artistic blend of winter and botanical elements: snow-capped mountains merge seamlessly with lush, elegant green monstera leaves, ferns, and delicate eucalyptus branches framing the scene. A few whimsical, cartoonish sushi pieces (like salmon nigiri and tuna maki) are scattered around like snowflakes falling in the background. In the center, in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\". The overall color palette is a mix of cool blues and whites for the snow with vibrant greens from the botanicals and the bright colors of the sushi. The composition is dynamic and funny, perfectly centered for a greeting card layout."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752510028.193693, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-d0d81cc5-9ed8-46a6-8225-41da79e5535e", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5a31e294.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752510028.193693, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous botanical birthday card illustration, 2D flat vector art style.
