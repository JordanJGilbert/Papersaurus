{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous watercolor greeting card front. Illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are the central focus. They are seated at a low Japanese-style table, surrounded by a delightful chaos of tiny, happy cartoon dogs of various small breeds, all with party hats. Lao Lao, in her black shirt, is laughing joyfully as she tries to fend off a tiny puppy who is playfully attempting to steal a piece of salmon nigiri from her chopsticks. Jordan, in his maroon t-shirt, grins widely as he holds up a large sushi platter, offering it towards Lao Lao, while another small dog at his feet begs for a treat. The scene is filled with colorful, oversized watercolor sushi rolls\u2014tuna maki, california rolls, and shrimp tempura\u2014that are scattered around the floor like playful building blocks. The background is a soft wash of light teal and pink watercolor, with subtle ink splatters adding to the dynamic, cheerful feel. Centered in the middle of the card, in a beautiful, readable, dark-gray handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\". Flat 2D artwork, soft edges, lighthearted and funny composition."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-54ff6f74fce1dd64d545a69e324815e2"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752524075.3522573, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-c3d34c53-442d-4281-b82a-1a0317f7d289", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_5a4eec29.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752524075.3522573, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous watercolor greeting card front.
