{"status": "processing", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. In a vibrant, soft watercolor style, create a humorous and whimsical scene featuring the people from the reference photo as illustrated characters.\n\nThe scene is set in a ridiculously over-the-top, cluttered video game room filled with stacks of games, multiple glowing screens, and tangled controller wires everywhere. Lao Lao is depicted as the victorious \"Level Up Queen,\" sitting triumphantly on a gamer chair throne, wearing a small, cute birthday crown tilted on her head. She holds a video game controller up in the air like a trophy, grinning with playful triumph. She is wearing the light blue sweatshirt from the photo.\n\nJordan is depicted kneeling comically on the floor beside her, presenting a large, beautifully decorated birthday cake with lit candles as if it's a precious offering or a legendary item from a video game. He has a funny, exaggerated expression of loving admiration and defeat. He is wearing the tan hoodie from the photo.\n\nColorful confetti and little video game power-up icons (like hearts and stars) float down around them. The background is a wash of soft blues, purples, and pinks, blending seamlessly with the watercolor aesthetic.\n\nIn the center, in an elegant, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite Player One, Lao Lao!\"", "backCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card back cover. A minimalist and elegant design in a soft watercolor style. A light wash of pale blues and soft purples creates a textured background, evocative of the front cover's color palette. In the top-left corner, a small, simple cluster of floating video game power-up icons (a heart, a star) painted with delicate, flowing colors. The overall design is very sparse, covering about 20% of the space, leaving the bottom-right corner completely empty. Artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds are visible.", "leftInterior": "Flat 2D illustration for the left interior of a greeting card. A subtle and decorative background in a soft watercolor painting style. The entire panel is a beautiful, abstract wash of soft blues, purples, and pinks, with gentle, flowing transitions between colors. Scattered delicately across the page are small, stylized video game power-up icons\u2014hearts, stars, and tiny coins\u2014that appear to be floating gently, as if suspended in water. The decoration covers about 40% of the page, concentrated more towards the edges to create a gentle framing effect, leaving the center relatively clear. The style features artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds, maintaining a cohesive look with the front cover.", "rightInterior": "Flat 2D illustration for the right interior of a greeting card, designed to hold a handwritten message. A full-bleed background of a very pale, textured watercolor wash using hints of soft blue and pink. The decoration is minimal, covering about 20% of the space. In the bottom-right corner, a single, elegant watercolor illustration of a classic video game controller, rendered in soft greys and purples with delicate lines. A few small, faded star icons drift upwards from the controller. This composition leaves the majority of the page as a large, clean, and inviting space for writing a personal message. The style matches the overall card, with soft flowing colors and visible paper texture."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "high", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": false, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": false, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-14e17147a542edd7b03cf6ea53d512cf"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752429512.748838, "progress": "Generating all card images in parallel..."}
