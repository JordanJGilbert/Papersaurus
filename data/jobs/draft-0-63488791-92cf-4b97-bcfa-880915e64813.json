{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous watercolor illustration for a birthday card front. The scene features a slightly frazzled, but happy cartoon hedgehog attempting to bake a magnificent birthday cake. The hedgehog, wearing a tiny, tilted chef's hat and a white apron smudged with flour and frosting, is precariously balanced on a stack of antique cookbooks to reach a large mixing bowl on a rustic wooden kitchen counter. Flour dusts the air in soft puffs, and splatters of colorful frosting dot the counter and the hedgehog's quills. The cake itself is a lopsided, multi-layered masterpiece, cheerfully decorated with sprinkles, a few comically dripping candles, and a single juicy strawberry on top. The background is a soft wash of warm kitchen colors\u2014creams, soft yellows, and pale blues\u2014with loose, flowing watercolor edges that blend seamlessly.\n\nIn the center of the image, integrated into the scene, the text \"Hope your birthday is a piece of cake!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script, in a dark chocolate brown ink. The style is flat 2D, perfect for printing, with the whimsical and artistic feel of a genuine watercolor painting."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752413776.786704, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-63488791-92cf-4b97-bcfa-880915e64813", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_b654d49d.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752413776.786704, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous watercolor illustration for a birthday card front.
