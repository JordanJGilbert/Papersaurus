{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and vibrant full-body watercolor illustration of a cartoon couple, closely resembling the people in the reference photo. The woman on the left, \"Lao Lao,\" has long, straight dark brown hair, wears gold-rimmed glasses, and a light yellow floral dress with pink flowers. The man on the right, \"Jordan,\" has short, textured dark hair and wears a simple white t-shirt.\n\nThey are depicted in a playful, chaotic kitchen scene, joyfully making a birthday feast. Lao Lao is laughing as she expertly folds a dumpling, with a bamboo steamer basket full of them nearby. Jordan, with a slightly panicked but happy expression, is stirring a huge, steaming pot of Chinese porridge (congee) that is threatening to bubble over. In the foreground, a giant, oversized boba tea cup sits between them, filled with milk tea and large tapioca pearls, with two straws in it for them to share. Little splashes of watercolor porridge and a few runaway dumplings are scattered around them on the floor, adding to the fun, messy atmosphere.\n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a soft, bright watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic paint bleeds, and soft edges. The background is a simple, light wash of color to keep the focus on the characters and the food.\n\nIn the center of the card, written in a beautiful, flowing handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ff03a8e80d6d29988aaedd519e972e89"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752332872.9998307, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-183c04d1-beb2-4397-9e79-aa8cae36ff0a", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_24730a8c.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752332872.9998307, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and vibrant full-body watercolor illustration of a cartoon couple, closely resembling the people in the reference photo.
