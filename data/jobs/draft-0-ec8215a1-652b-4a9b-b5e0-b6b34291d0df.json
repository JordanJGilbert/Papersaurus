{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting of two cartoon characters, a grandmother and a young boy, highly resembling the people in the reference photo [621738c4-abcd-4d4a-a3c5-189c14feac37]. The characters are drawn in a humorous, exaggerated style, with big, expressive eyes and wide smiles, capturing a moment of playful joy. The grandmother (Lao Lao) is playfully chasing the little boy, who is running just out of her reach with a mischievous grin. They are both wearing the exact same clothing, hairstyles, and have the same body proportions as in the photo, but with logos/text omitted. The background is a simple, soft wash of cheerful pastel colors, with artistic paint splatters and organic bleeds suggesting movement and energy. In the center, written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday to the Best Lao Lao!\". The overall style is flat 2D, with visible paper texture, soft flowing colors, and artistic brush strokes, creating a lighthearted and funny scene.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-7104b2361d48d285e7f3d730f9b28858"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752282764.1475878, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-ec8215a1-652b-4a9b-b5e0-b6b34291d0df", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4c20fa4b.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752282764.1475878, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor painting of two cartoon characters, a grandmother and a young boy, highly resembling the people in the reference photo [621738c4-abcd-4d4a-a3c5-189c14feac37].
