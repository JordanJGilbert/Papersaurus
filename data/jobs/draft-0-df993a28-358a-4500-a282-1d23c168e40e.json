{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and funny watercolor illustration for a birthday card front. The scene is set in a cozy, brightly lit living room with soft, flowing colors and a hand-painted feel.\n\nIn the foreground, a tiny, mischievous puppy is the star of the show, triumphantly trotting away with a comically oversized slice of pepperoni pizza in its mouth, cheese stretching dramatically back towards an open pizza box on the floor.\n\nAt the center, illustrated versions of Lao Lao (person on the left in the photo) and Jordan (person on the right in the photo) are crouched down, frozen in a moment of playful panic. Both are wearing colorful, slightly askew paper party hats. Lao Lao is reaching out with one hand, her expression a mix of laughter and mock horror. Jordan is beside her, holding a squeaky dog toy, his face showing comic desperation as he tries to coax the puppy back.\n\nThe background has soft, blurry details like a comfy armchair and a small side table, keeping the focus on the main action. The entire image has the soft edges and transparent layers characteristic of watercolor art, with a light and airy feel.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned safely away from the edges, is the greeting text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, hand-lettered cursive script that looks like it was painted with ink. The overall composition is dynamic, funny, and full of personality.
