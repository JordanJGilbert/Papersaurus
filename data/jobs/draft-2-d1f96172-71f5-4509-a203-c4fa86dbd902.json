{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor illustration of a family of five, transformed into humorous cartoon characters, standing on a giant conveyor belt carrying various delicious-looking, oversized sushi pieces (like tuna nigiri, salmon roe, and tamago).

He is humorously trying to balance on a wobbly piece of ikura (salmon roe) sushi.\n- The young man next to him, with short dark hair, a dark gray bomber jacket, and black pants, is surfing on a sleek tuna nigiri piece like it's a surfboard.\n- The woman in the middle has long dark hair, a black jacket, and dark blue jeans, and she is relaxing comfortably on a piece of tamago (egg) sushi as if it's a lounge chair.\n- The second woman, with long dark brown hair and a big smile, wears a puffy maroon coat and jeans, happily waving from atop a California roll.\n- The young woman on the right, with long dark hair, a black and white sweater, and patterned light blue jeans, is depicted playfully trying to catch a flying shrimp tempura with chopsticks.\n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds, creating a funny and lighthearted \"sushi dream\" atmosphere.\n\nIn the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text:\n\n\"Hope your Japan trip was Soy amazing!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "japan trip", "toField": "", "fromField": "", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-98cdd699843ffbfa798f80235df750f3"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752296405.4847965, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-d1f96172-71f5-4509-a203-c4fa86dbd902", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_55d18010.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752296405.4847965, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A watercolor illustration of a family of five, transformed into humorous cartoon characters, standing on a giant conveyor belt carrying various delicious-looking, oversized sushi pieces (like tuna nigiri, salmon roe, and tamago).
