{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous botanical illustration for a greeting card front. In a lush, overgrown garden setting, two cartoon-style characters, based on Jordan and Lao Lao from the reference photo, are playfully interacting with giant, fantastical plants. Jordan, maintaining his happy expression from the photo, is comically tangled in the thick, curling vines of a massive, Dr. Seuss-like flowering plant. He is wearing the black graduation gown and the colorful floral lei from the photo, but instead of a graduation stole, it's a vine with funny-looking pitcher plants on it. Lao Lao, based on the person on the left in the photo, is standing beside him, wearing her white ruffled dress, and is using oversized garden shears to comically try and snip him free, laughing with a playful expression. The background is a soft, light cream color, filled with detailed botanical elements like oversized ferns, whimsical mushrooms with polka dots, and small, cheerful birds flitting about. The overall style is flat 2D vector art with clean lines, a vibrant but earthy color palette, and a charming, storybook feel. In the center of the card, in a clear space between the characters, the words \"Happy Birthday to my favorite human bean\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Craig", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-03bca1782f337d20c9df9f264ad7761b"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752538376.2059345, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-7b1b5b2c-8ce5-41e7-bc1e-1dcaef4de81a", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_cf5b95d8.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752538376.2059345, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous botanical illustration for a greeting card front.
