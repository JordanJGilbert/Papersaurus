{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a birthday card, minimalist and heartfelt style, solid cream-colored background.\n\nCentral illustration features a stylized, simplified cartoon version of Grandpa from the reference photo, sitting contentedly on a minimalist wooden stool. He is depicted in his grey turtleneck sweater and pants. He is holding a small, decorative Chinese opera mask in one hand, smiling gently. Seated on the floor at his feet is a cartoon version of Tong Tong from the reference photo, wearing the red sweater (with simple shapes instead of the original design). Tong Tong is looking up at Grandpa with a happy, adoring expression, offering him a large, stylized steamed crab on a simple white plate.\n\nFloating gracefully around them are delicate, minimalist line drawings: a small fishing boat (sampan), a shrimp, and a fish, all rendered in a soft, elegant ink wash style. These elements are arranged artfully in the background space, creating a sense of a shared, cherished memory.\n\nIn the center of the card, positioned above the main illustration, the text \"Happy Birthday, Grandpa\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, dark brown handwritten cursive script.\n\nThe overall composition is clean, emotional, and centered, with plenty of negative space, evoking a tender, personal, and artistic feel."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Grandpa", "fromField": "Tong Tong", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-8aeb0d618355b483f19c973a103cffd6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752515642.4188383, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-961eafe6-a491-4c34-a691-747b8dbaa594", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_be4c8db6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752515642.4188383, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a birthday card, minimalist and heartfelt style, solid cream-colored background.\n\nCentral illustration features a stylized, simplified cartoon version of Grandpa from the reference photo, sitting contentedly on a minimalist wooden stool.
