{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant and action-packed comic book cover, flat 2D artwork. In a dynamic scene, Jordan is depicted as a superhero, \"Code Commander,\" sitting heroically at a futuristic computer desk with multiple holographic screens displaying lines of glowing green code. He is wearing the black t-shirt from the photo, reimagined as a superhero uniform. Lao Lao, his \"Sidekick,\" wearing her white athletic jacket, zips into the scene on a snowboard, leaving a trail of ice and snow. She's joyfully presenting a giant, perfectly marbled wagyu steak on a platter with a birthday candle in it. The background is a chaotic and colorful explosion of their favorite things: giant pieces of sushi (tuna nigiri, salmon rolls) and Chinese food (steaming dumplings, takeout boxes) fly through the air amidst classic comic book action lines and \"POW!\" \"ZAP!\" sound effects. The overall composition is energetic and humorous, with bold colors, thick black outlines, and Ben-Day dot patterns. In the center of the card, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, and slightly stylized handwritten cursive script, fitting neatly within a comic book style caption box."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553990.0489657, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-e9a5eaa8-a677-4650-ad92-524d0e7aacb3", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4ead2c57.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553990.0489657, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A vibrant and action-packed comic book cover, flat 2D artwork.
