{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor birthday card for Lao Lao. In the center, two cartoon-illustrated characters, a grandmother and a young adult, are depicted from the waist up, captured in a dynamic and funny pose. The grandmother character (Lao Lao), based on the reference photo [64a9cd66-2140-49e5-8967-3b5ce0b52f03], is playfully flexing her bicep with a proud and mischievous grin, while the young adult character, also from the photo, cheers her on with an expression of joyful amazement. They are wearing the exact same clothing as in the photo, with any logos or text removed. The characters highly resemble the people in the reference photo, maintaining their hairstyles, facial features, and proportions in a charming, illustrated style. The entire scene is a flat 2D artwork in a beautiful watercolor style, featuring soft, flowing colors, visible artistic brushstrokes, subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges. Splashes of joyful, confetti-like watercolor paint float around the characters. In the center of the card, positioned safely away from the edges, the text \"Happy Birthday to the Strongest Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a8e679d5c11513cc9a7d3515cf9cd43a"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752282453.0684917, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-7c5e1223-b6f7-43e6-8c14-864e4e5b5237", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_9a45a6c3.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752282453.0684917, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor birthday card for Lao Lao.
