{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and beautifully rendered watercolor illustration of Lao Lao as the star of her own cooking show. She is depicted as a cartoon/illustrated character, highly resembling her reference photo, including her exact hairstyle, facial features, body proportions, and her purple and white floral patterned shirt. She stands behind a kitchen counter, joyfully and perhaps a little chaotically, tossing a stir-fry in a large wok with exaggerated flair, sending illustrated vegetables flying playfully in the air around her. Jordan, also as a cartoon/illustrated character highly resembling his reference photo (including hairstyle, facial features, proportions, and his gray t-shirt), stands beside her with a big, amused smile, holding an empty bowl and chopsticks, eagerly waiting for a taste. The entire scene is captured in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. Centered in the middle of the design, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to the World's Best Lao Lao!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-4e8fd38a8183241a80149432346ebf03"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752283323.1521883, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-98af3d1f-b5ce-437c-9c4e-5c0949d6a5f5", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_b7ad59ad.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752283323.1521883, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and beautifully rendered watercolor illustration of Lao Lao as the star of her own cooking show.
