{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A funny and lighthearted watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover. The scene is a bright, sunny beach with soft, sandy shores and gentle blue ocean waves in the background. In the center, a cartoon woman, representing Lao Lao (no reference photo, so create a happy, elderly Asian woman with kind eyes, smiling warmly, with grey hair in a bun), sits majestically on a throne made entirely of intricately detailed mahjong tiles (green bamboo, red dragons, character tiles). She is depicted as a queen, wearing a small, playful crown slightly askew on her head. In one hand, she holds a comically oversized bubble tea with large tapioca pearls visible. To her right, a cartoon version of a young man stands, based on the reference photo (man on the right): dark short tousled hair, a broad warm smile with very white teeth, wearing a white t-shirt, happily looking towards the queen. To her left, a cartoon version of a young woman stands, based on the reference photo (woman on the left): long straight black hair, wearing thin gold-rimmed circular glasses, a yellow top/sundress with a red floral pattern, also smiling happily. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. In the center of the image, elegant, readable, handwritten cursive script says \"Happy Birthday\". The overall tone is joyful, funny, and celebratory.
