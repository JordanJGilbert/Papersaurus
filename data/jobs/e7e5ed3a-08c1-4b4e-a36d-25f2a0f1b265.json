{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Humorous and lighthearted birthday card front cover, flat 2D watercolor painting style with flowing colors and soft edges. The scene is a chaotic and funny downhill snowboard race on a snowy mountain under a bright blue sky.\n\nThe two main characters are illustrated cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo. Lao Lao, wearing a vibrant snowboard jacket and pants, is in the lead, expertly carving down the slope on her snowboard with a confident, mischievous grin. Snow kicks up playfully behind her board.\n\nSlightly behind her, Jordan is on his own snowboard, but in a comically precarious pose. He's hilariously off-balance, arms flailing, with a wide-eyed, surprised expression as he tries to keep from wiping out. He's holding leashes attached to two very happy and energetic cartoon dogs (e.g., a Golden Retriever and a Corgi) who are gleefully pulling him down the mountain like a sled team, their tongues out and ears flapping in the wind. One dog is wearing a tiny party hat.\n\nThe background features soft watercolor pine trees dusted with snow and gentle slopes. Scattered around the scene are subtle birthday elements, like a few colorful balloons tangled in a tree branch and a birthday banner that seems to have been knocked over in the snow.\n\nCentered on the card, in a clear area of the sky between the characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script.\n\nREFINEMENT NOTE: A rough draft of this exact image is provided as reference. Create a high-quality final version that:\n- Maintains the exact same composition, character positions, and overall design\n- Enhances details, textures, and color vibrancy\n- Corrects any minor imperfections or artifacts\n- Adds professional polish while staying true to the draft\n- Think of this as the \"final art\" version of the provided sketch\n\nORIGINAL CONTEXT TO MAINTAIN:\n- To: Lao Lao\n- From: Jordan\n- Relationship: Lao Lao is Jordan's girlfriend\n- Personal Traits to incorporate: snowboarding and dogs\n- Reference photos of: Lao lao on left, jordan on right", "backCover": "Minimalist back cover of a greeting card.
