The scene features illustrated cartoon versions of the couple from the reference photo against a clean white background with subtle paper texture and organic paint bleeds.\n\nOn the left, an illustrated cartoon character of Lao Lao, an East Asian woman with long, straight dark brown hair, a warm smile, and thin gold-rimmed glasses, is wearing a black long-sleeved shirt. She is holding a giant, comically oversized cup of boba tea, struggling to lift it with a funny, strained expression.\n\nOn the right, an illustrated cartoon character of Jordan, an East Asian man with spiky, textured dark hair, is wearing a maroon t-shirt. He has a wide, happy grin and is comically attempting to take a massive bite out of a gigantic bahn mi that's so large it's bending in the middle.\n\nBetween them, on a small table, sits a steaming bowl of Chinese porridge with a spoon sticking out. The overall composition is chaotic, fun, and food-focused, with soft, flowing watercolor colors and artistic brush strokes.\n\nCentered on the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!
