{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover. A humorous and lighthearted beach birthday party scene, rendered in a beautiful flat 2D watercolor style with soft, blended colors and delicate ink outlines.\n\nThe scene features cartoon versions of Lao Lao (from the left of the photo) and Jordan (from the right of the photo). Lao Lao is in the foreground, laughing joyfully as she is being playfully chased down the sandy shoreline by three small, fluffy, and comically excited dogs. One of the dogs, a little scruffy terrier mix, has a tiny birthday party hat perched sideways on its head. Another dog, a fluffy poodle mix, is mid-air, leaping for a squeaky toy hotdog she holds just out of reach.\n\nIn the mid-ground, Jordan stands beside a ridiculously oversized, multi-tiered sandcastle decorated with seashells and seaweed \"confetti.\" He's holding a half-built birthday banner that humorously reads \"Happy Birth...\" with the \"day\" part drooping into the sand. He has a funny, slightly exasperated but loving expression as he watches the chaotic chase unfold.\n\nThe beach setting is idyllic, with gentle turquoise waves lapping at the shore. The sand is a warm golden color with watercolor splashes and speckles. A couple of stray beach toys, like a bright red pail and a blue shovel, are scattered in the foreground.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating in a clear area of the sky above the action, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, dark teal handwritten cursive script. The composition is dynamic and full of life, with a clean white border framing the artwork."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-dd3813ea41f0bca555dc22f82eccad0b"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752448898.2328005, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-847adf59-99ab-41b8-95aa-e8eacf59120e", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_ce8705f6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752448898.2328005, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover.
