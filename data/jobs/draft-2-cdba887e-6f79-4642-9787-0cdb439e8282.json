A cartoon-illustrated young East Asian woman and a young Southeast Asian man, highly resembling the people in the reference photo, are standing side-by-side in a comically oversized dim sum steamer basket. The woman, on the left, has long, straight dark brown hair, wears gold-rimmed glasses, and has a bright, happy smile. She is wearing a light blue crewneck sweatshirt (plain, no logo) and black pants. The man, standing slightly behind her on the right, has short, dark, textured hair and a wide, cheerful grin. He is wearing a plain tan-colored hoodie and dark maroon pants. They are both holding giant, comically large chopsticks, struggling playfully to pick up a single, tiny shumai dumpling that sits between them in the steamer. The entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. In the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, the text reads: \"Thanks for everything, Lao Lao! You're the best, dim sum and then some!\" The background is a simple, light cream color with soft, subtle watercolor washes to keep the focus on the characters.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "thank-you", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0c2973d3ea698342f3d0277869c1bda8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284212.752041, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-cdba887e-6f79-4642-9787-0cdb439e8282", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_74609ed2.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284212.752041, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D watercolor painting of a humorous scene for a greeting card front.
