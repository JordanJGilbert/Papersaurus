{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front. In the center, a cartoonish, slightly grumpy-looking badger is comedically entangled in a lush, elegantly drawn wreath of flowering vines, sage green eucalyptus leaves, and delicate fern fronds. The badger, rendered in a soft, storybook style, has one paw raised as if to say \"honestly!\", with a few stray leaves and a small pink blossom stuck in its fur. Surrounding this central scene, more botanical elements like small lavender sprigs and tiny white baby's breath flowers are scattered artfully. In the safe center area, elegantly lettered in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text \"Happy Birthday to my favorite little badger, Lao Lao\". The background is a clean, solid off-white, allowing the vibrant greens and pops of floral color to stand out. The overall aesthetic is a delightful mix of sophisticated botanical art and playful, lighthearted humor."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752525836.6848218, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-2af8d05f-f770-4ae1-9475-adc5ba9cf0d2", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8481f91c.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752525836.6848218, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A charming and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front.
