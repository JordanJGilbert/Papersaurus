{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny botanical beach scene. Flat 2D illustration with a clean, modern aesthetic and a pastel color palette.\n\nIn the center, an illustrated cartoon version of Lao Lao from the reference photo, wearing her blue sweatshirt (logo removed), is comically trying to drag a ridiculously oversized, vintage-style striped beach umbrella towards the water. She's laughing, pulling with exaggerated effort. Her cartoon boyfriend, Jordan, based on the reference photo and wearing his tan hoodie, stands beside her, not helping, but instead playfully holding up two coconut drinks with little umbrellas, a big grin on his face as if presenting a prize.\n\nThe beach scene is stylized: gentle, light-blue waves lap at a sandy shore dotted with cute, illustrated seashells and starfish. Instead of typical palm trees, the scene is framed by an arch of lush, oversized botanical leaves and tropical flowers like hibiscus and bird of paradise, rendered in a beautiful, artistic style. This creates a unique \"botanical beach\" vibe. A few cartoon seagulls fly overhead wearing tiny party hats.\n\nIn the upper-middle of the card, positioned within the botanical arch, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script in a dark teal color. The overall composition is balanced, charming, and humorous, with the characters as the focal point."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-51c5fa355604b95677dc32a1f19c876f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752519768.3151908, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-3e67a9f3-ac00-4320-928e-268adf442b42", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_dbb89cb6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752519768.3151908, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, a whimsical and funny botanical beach scene.
