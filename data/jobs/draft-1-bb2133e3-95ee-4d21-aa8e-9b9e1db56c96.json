{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A beautiful and humorous 2D flat illustration for a birthday card front. The scene is a quirky, stylized tropical beach.\n\nIn the center, an illustrated version of Lao Lao (from the photo, left) is relaxing in an oversized, clear boba cup that's partially buried in the sand like a beach chair. She has a happy, surprised expression as she holds a tiny beach umbrella over her head. The \"boba pearls\" in the cup are actually small, perfectly round coconuts. She is wearing a simple summer top.\n\nNext to her, an illustrated version of Jordan (from the photo, right) is comically struggling to build a sandcastle, but instead of using a pail, he's using a giant, upside-down boba tea cup as a mold. He has a funny, determined expression. He wears a casual t-shirt and shorts.\n\nThe beach scene is lush and botanical, with stylized palm leaves, hibiscus flowers, and monstera leaves framing the top corners of the card. The sand is a soft beige, and the ocean in the background is a gentle turquoise with playful, simple waves.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating just above the couple in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\". The color of the text is a deep teal.\n\nThe overall art style is whimsical, clean, and modern, with a soft color palette of pastels, greens, and blues, creating a charming and personal botanical beach paradise."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752447420.0607784, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-bb2133e3-95ee-4d21-aa8e-9b9e1db56c96", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_9ae1e1e9.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447420.0607784, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A beautiful and humorous 2D flat illustration for a birthday card front.
