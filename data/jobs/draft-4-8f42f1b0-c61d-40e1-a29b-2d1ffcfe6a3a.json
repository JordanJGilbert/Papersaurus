{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of an anniversary card in a minimalist, modern art style with simple shapes and a soft pastel color palette. The scene is a romantic beach picnic at sunset. In the foreground, illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are sitting close together on a simple, patterned beach blanket. Lao Lao, wearing a cozy blue sweatshirt, leans her head gently on Jordan's shoulder, who is wearing a tan hoodie. They both have sweet, content smiles as they look out at the ocean. They are each holding a unique drink: boba tea served inside a real coconut shell, complete with a wide boba straw. Between them on the blanket is a small, elegant picnic setup with a few pieces of tropical fruit like mango slices and starfruit.\n\nThe background is a serene, minimalist representation of a beach at sunset. The sky is a gradient of soft pink, orange, and lavender. The sun is a simple, glowing orb just touching the horizon line of the calm, light blue ocean. A few simple, elegant lines indicate gentle waves lapping the shore. The entire composition is clean, with plenty of negative space to feel peaceful and uncluttered.\n\nCentered in the middle of the illustration, in the sky above the ocean, is the text \"Happy Anniversary, My Love\" written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The text is easily readable and positioned safely away from the edges."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-a3a320708e462756adceed204a77ee73"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752427593.1926348, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-8f42f1b0-c61d-40e1-a29b-2d1ffcfe6a3a", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_af0ea90f.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752427593.1926348, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration of an anniversary card in a minimalist, modern art style with simple shapes and a soft pastel color palette.
