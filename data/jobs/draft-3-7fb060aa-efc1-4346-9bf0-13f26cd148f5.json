{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card. A whimsical and humorous fantasy scene combining snowboarding and sushi. In the center, Jordan from the photo, transformed into a cartoon character, is skillfully snowboarding down a giant, glistening California roll as if it were a snowy half-pipe. He wears a gray jacket over a maroon t-shirt (logos omitted) and has a joyful, concentrated expression. His snowboard kicks up a spray of rice and tobiko instead of snow. Lao Lao, also as a cartoon character based on the photo, wears her glasses and a light-colored jacket, gleefully riding on Jordan's shoulders. She's laughing and holding a pair of oversized chopsticks, trying to catch flying pieces of shrimp tempura and avocado that are tossed up by their movement.\n\nThe background is a dreamy, magical mountain range made entirely of sushi. The peaks are topped with dollops of wasabi and pickled ginger, and the landscape is dotted with nigiri \"trees\" and sashimi \"rivers\" under a soft, pastel-colored sky with fluffy, cloud-like formations of soy sauce. The overall aesthetic is ethereal and fantastical, with a lighthearted and funny tone.\n\nIn the upper-middle area, the text \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and readable handwritten cursive script. The composition is dynamic and full of playful energy."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-596dac4070073841468dd18a2ce1be73"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752510376.2808487, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-7fb060aa-efc1-4346-9bf0-13f26cd148f5", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_6547f598.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752510376.2808487, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card.
