{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, pop art comic book style, featuring an action-packed, humorous scene on a snowy mountain peak under a bright blue sky. A cartoon illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo is mid-air on a snowboard, expertly grabbing the edge of her board with a huge, joyful smile. A cartoon version of Jordan from the photo is comically half-buried head-first in a pile of snow at the bottom of a small jump, his snowboard sticking up in the air. A pack of three adorable, cartoonishly enthusiastic dogs (a Golden Retriever, a Husky, and a small Corgi) are wearing tiny goggles and bandanas, cheering from the sidelines and kicking up snow. The entire scene is framed with dynamic action lines and a vibrant sunburst pattern in the background. In the center of the card, a large, yellow comic book-style speech bubble contains the words \"Happy Birthday, My Superhero!\" in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script. The artwork is flat 2D with bold outlines, halftone dot patterns for shading, and a bright, saturated color palette of cyan, magenta, and yellow."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-b849efeb798f6ff34a0179d41fa1f289"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752522646.577217, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-65f66a78-a7c9-4b57-b683-c6cea973e8a1", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_f4b7c88a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752522646.577217, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, pop art comic book style, featuring an action-packed, humorous scene on a snowy mountain peak under a bright blue sky.
