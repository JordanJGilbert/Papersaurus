{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Minimalist flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. Against a clean, solid light grey background, a cartoon illustrated version of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are in a humorous, dynamic scene.\n\nLao Lao is on the left, joyfully riding a snowboard that is comically balanced atop a giant, elegant birthday cake instead of snow. The cake is minimalist, with simple white frosting and a few understated pastel sprinkles. Lao Lao is wearing a simplified version of her white dress from the photo, smiling brightly as she masterfully balances.\n\nJordan is on the right, striking a playful pose, holding up a large dog biscuit like a gold medal for Lao Lao. He is wearing a simplified version of his dark outfit from the photo. Standing attentively at his feet are two cute, minimalist cartoon dogs (one a Shiba Inu, one a Golden Retriever), both looking up at Lao Lao with admiration and wagging tails.\n\nThe entire scene is composed with plenty of negative space, focusing on the characters and the central action. The style is clean, using simple shapes and a limited, soft color palette.\n\nIn the center of the design, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao\""}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-b849efeb798f6ff34a0179d41fa1f289"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752522645.6135874, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-7bb6bf7e-1b3c-455a-bfd7-06ac3b5686ac", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_a01ee5d4.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752522645.6135874, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Minimalist flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
