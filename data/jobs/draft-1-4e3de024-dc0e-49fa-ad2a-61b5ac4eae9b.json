She has a huge, happy smile and is reaching out with one hand towards a fantastical rocket ship. Jordan, also as a cartoon astronaut in a matching botanical-themed suit, floats just behind her, giving her a playful push forward from her back, a big grin on his face as if launching her towards the cake. They both wear glass helmets, through which their happy expressions are clearly visible.\n\nThe rocket ship is humorously shaped like a magnificent, three-tiered birthday cake with white frosting, colorful sprinkle-planets orbiting it, and a single, large candle at the top acting as the rocket's antenna, its flame a soft, glowing light.\n\nThe \"space\" around them is filled not with typical stars, but with a scattered arrangement of beautiful botanical elements: star-shaped white jasmine flowers, swirling constellations made of silver dollar eucalyptus leaves, and planetary orbs illustrated as lush, round terrariums containing different types of ferns and succulents. The Milky Way is a gentle sweep of baby's breath flowers.\n\nIn the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, My Love\".
