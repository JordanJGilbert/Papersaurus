A funny and charming scene is set on a pretty beach with soft white sand and gentle turquoise waves. In the center, cartoon-illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are sitting on a picnic blanket, having a romantic but comical anniversary dinner. Lao Lao, smiling joyfully, is about to eat a piece of shumai with chopsticks, while Jordan playfully attempts to feed her a piece of kung pao chicken from a takeout container. Surrounding them are several open Chinese food takeout boxes with various dishes like noodles, dumplings, and spring rolls. The entire scene is framed by a lush botanical archway made of tropical leaves, monstera plants, and hibiscus flowers, weaving the beach and botanical themes together. The overall aesthetic is whimsical, bright, and heartwarming.\n\nIn the center of the card, in a clear space above the couple, the text \"Happy Anniversary, my favorite dim sum\" is written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script.\n\nArtwork style: Flat 2D illustration, clean lines, vibrant color palette, matte finish, whimsical and modern."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-d1af38ed4db92f93d2da15e4947adf2d"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752504689.3705263, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-a63a8737-633a-4c03-9770-b5cd6b05faf8", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_b58591bb.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752504689.3705263, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, beautiful botanical illustration, humorous and lighthearted anniversary theme.
