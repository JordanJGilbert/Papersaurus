{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A dynamic and humorous comic book cover illustration for a birthday card. The scene is a vibrant, sun-drenched beach. In the foreground, an illustrated version of Lao Lao from the photo, wearing her blue sweatshirt (without logo) and black pants, is depicted as a superhero. She has a triumphant, laughing expression and strikes a classic superhero pose, one fist raised high. With her other hand, she playfully holds back an illustrated Jordan (from the photo, wearing his brown hoodie and dark pants), who is comically struggling to escape the grasp of a giant, mischievous cartoon crab that has gently clamped onto his leg. Jordan has a look of mock panic and surprise. The background is a full comic book panel with bold action lines radiating outwards, a \"KAPOW!\" sound effect bubble near the crab, and a beautiful blue ocean with playful waves. In the center of the illustration, in a clean space with no action lines, the text \"Happy Birthday to my Superhero!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, handwritten cursive script. The art style is flat 2D with thick black outlines, Ben-Day dots for shading, and a bright, saturated color palette of yellows, cyans, and magentas typical of vintage comics."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "lao lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-10653ca1f257ec5a12f90a680470ad55"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752555070.6880171, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-3564b197-138e-4620-874c-630110481d2e", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_27bb1198.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752555070.6880171, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A dynamic and humorous comic book cover illustration for a birthday card.
