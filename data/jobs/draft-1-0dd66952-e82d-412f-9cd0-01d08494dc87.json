{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front. In a charming cartoon style, Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are depicted in a funny, chaotic scene. They are tumbling comically down a gentle, snowy slope on a single, oversized snowboard. Lao Lao, wearing her white dress, is at the front, looking back with a laughing, surprised expression, her arms flailing playfully. Jordan, in his graduation gown (no logos), is right behind her, also laughing and trying to maintain balance with an exaggerated pose.\n\nSurrounding them is not a typical mountain scene, but a lush botanical winter wonderland. Instead of pine trees, there are large, stylized tropical leaves like monstera and banana leaves, all dusted with a magical layer of sparkling snow. Interspersed are vibrant alpine flowers like edelweiss and gentian.\n\nFor an extra layer of humor, two cartoon dogs (a goofy Golden Retriever and a mischievous Corgi) are gleefully chasing after them, one wearing a tiny birthday hat and the other with a little red scarf, kicking up puffs of snow.\n\nThe entire scene has a soft, light-filled atmosphere with a pastel color palette of mint green, soft blues, and warm creams, complemented by the vibrant colors of the flowers.\n\nIn the center of the image, floating in a clear area, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-b849efeb798f6ff34a0179d41fa1f289"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752522646.541577, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-0dd66952-e82d-412f-9cd0-01d08494dc87", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c773aebd.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752522646.541577, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A whimsical and humorous flat 2D botanical illustration for a greeting card front.
