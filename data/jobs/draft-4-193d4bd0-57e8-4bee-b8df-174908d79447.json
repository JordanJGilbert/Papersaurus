A funny and lighthearted scene set against a clean, solid cream background.\n\nIn the center, an illustrated cartoon version of Jordan from the reference photo, wearing his dark t-shirt, is joyfully snowboarding down a slope made of giant, stylized binary code (0s and 1s). He has a big, happy grin.\n\nInstead of snow, a flurry of tiny, simplified icons representing his favorite things rains down around him: cute sushi rolls, perfectly seared wagyu steak cubes, and little Chinese take-out boxes. He's trying to catch them with his mouth open like snowflakes.\n\nFollowing closely behind him on her own snowboard is the cartoon version of Lao Lao from the photo, wearing her white zip-up top. She is laughing, with one arm playfully extended, about to toss a piece of sushi towards Jordan.\n\nThe composition is dynamic and clean, with the characters as the main focus. The overall aesthetic is simple, with elegant shapes and a limited color palette that complements the characters' clothing.\n\nCentered below the illustration, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday, Jordan\"."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "laotongli124@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Jordan", "fromField": "Lao Lao", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-cf01b1f11dd4934f22e0a34bc574a032"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752553988.2139843, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-193d4bd0-57e8-4bee-b8df-174908d79447", "prompt": "Generated card for laotongli124@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_44487450.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752553988.2139843, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Minimalist, flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
