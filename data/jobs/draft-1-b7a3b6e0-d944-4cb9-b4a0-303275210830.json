{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. A funny and charming botanical scene featuring cartoon-style versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo. They are sitting on a whimsical, oversized monstera leaf that acts as a park bench.\n\nLao Lao, on the left, is laughing with a joyful, slightly mischievous expression as she tries to balance a wobbly, comically tall stack of three boba tea cups in her hands. Jordan, on the right, looks on with an adoring, amused smile, one arm gently reaching out as if to help stabilize the boba tower. They are wearing the same outfits from the photo (Lao Lao in the blue sweatshirt and black pants, Jordan in the tan hoodie and dark pants), but with any logos or text omitted.\n\nSurrounding them is a lush, playful botanical environment. Instead of regular flowers, the plants are growing boba teas, with tapioca pearls visible inside translucent blossoms. Two adorable, cartoon Corgis with happy expressions are playfully chasing floating tapioca pearls near their feet. The background is a soft, solid pastel color, making the central scene pop.\n\nIn the center of the card, floating gracefully above the couple's heads, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script in a dark teal color. The overall composition is balanced, vibrant, and full of lighthearted personality."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f3f3def4095e22da7fb8370623c4f9b1"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752520142.8006706, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-b7a3b6e0-d944-4cb9-b4a0-303275210830", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8ba24def.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752520142.8006706, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
