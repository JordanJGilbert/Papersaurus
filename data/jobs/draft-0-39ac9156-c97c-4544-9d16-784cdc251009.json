{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "[ID: 1d18dd33-41c7-4779-86db-bbb37d98d299] A humorous and dynamic watercolor painting for a greeting card front. The scene is a chaotic and funny combination of skiing and boba tea. Lao Lao, the person on the right in the photo, is illustrated wearing a stylish ski jacket and goggles pushed up on her head, skiing downhill with perfect form but looking back over her shoulder with a huge, joyful, laughing expression. Instead of ski poles, she expertly balances two giant, oversized boba milk tea cups, one in each hand, with huge straws sticking out. Jordan, the person on the left in the photo, is illustrated comically tumbling downhill behind her, skis and poles akimbo in a classic cartoon wipeout pose, with a surprised but happy expression on his face. He's also wearing winter ski gear. Boba pearls are scattered comically in the air and on the snowy slope around them, as if they've spilled from their chaotic descent. The background is a soft watercolor wash of a snowy mountain landscape with gentle pine trees and a light blue sky. The entire scene has a bright, lighthearted feel, with soft edges and blended colors characteristic of a watercolor style. Centered in a clear area of the sky above the action, the text \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. Flat 2D artwork, greeting card composition."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f2a797f6db576724bce84b81484f86b8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752413993.79561, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-39ac9156-c97c-4544-9d16-784cdc251009", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_88cf6da5.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752413993.79561, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "[ID: 1d18dd33-41c7-4779-86db-bbb37d98d299] A humorous and dynamic watercolor painting for a greeting card front.
