{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A funny minimalist illustration of a birthday pizza party gone wrong. In the center, a tiny, mischievous dog with big puppy eyes is triumphantly running away with a ridiculously oversized slice of pepperoni pizza that's dragging on the floor behind it. The slice is almost bigger than the dog itself. To the left, an illustrated version of Lao Lao, wearing a silly, conical birthday party hat, is lunging forward with a dramatic, open-mouthed expression of playful shock, one arm outstretched towards the dog. To the right, an illustrated version of Jordan, also wearing a matching party hat, is down on one knee, dramatically trying to lure the dog back with an empty dog bowl, his face a perfect picture of mock desperation. They are both wearing the casual clothes from the photo (Lao Lao in her blue sweatshirt, Jordan in his tan hoodie). The background is a clean, solid pastel color, with a few stray pieces of confetti scattered around to suggest a party. In the center of the scene, above the action, the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, flowing, handwritten cursive script. The entire scene is rendered in a flat, 2D minimalist style with clean lines and simple shapes."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-0f1bf2a18918634e4dd4baf99cc9e8fa"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752431726.6190832, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-c196b370-6dee-43bb-9c19-1506aef56965", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_f2cd2e77.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752431726.6190832, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A funny minimalist illustration of a birthday pizza party gone wrong.
