{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover. A whimsical and humorous watercolor illustration of a beautiful beach scene, celebrating a birthday.\n\n**Scene:**\nThe setting is a picturesque sandy beach with gentle turquoise waves rolling onto the shore. The sky is a soft blend of watercolor blues and yellows, suggesting a bright, happy day. Instead of traditional seashells, the sand is humorously scattered with delicious-looking Chinese food items: a few steamed dumplings, a couple of spring rolls, and a stray piece of broccoli from a beef and broccoli dish, all painted in a charming watercolor style. In the background, a playful crab is wearing a tiny birthday party hat and carrying a single, oversized noodle.\n\n**Characters:**\nIn the foreground, illustrated versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are having a fun, slightly silly moment.\n- **Lao Lao** is joyfully sitting on a large, intricately designed dim sum steamer basket as if it's a beach throne. She's wearing a light blue sweatshirt and has a huge, happy smile, laughing as she holds up a pair of chopsticks triumphantly.\n- **Jordan** is standing beside her, wearing a brown hoodie. He's playfully trying to build a \"sandcastle\" that is actually made of a giant mound of fried rice, complete with a tiny paper umbrella stuck in the top. He has a warm, loving smile on his face as he looks at Lao Lao.\n\n**Art Style:**\nThe entire scene is rendered in a vibrant, flat 2D watercolor style. Colors are bright and bleed into each other softly at the edges. The linework is loose and expressive, giving the illustration a handcrafted, lighthearted feel. The overall composition is joyful, personal, and full of charming, funny details.\n\n**Text:**\nIn the center of the card, positioned in the open space above the characters, the words \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" are written in a beautiful, flowing, and easily readable handwritten cursive script. The text color is a deep, warm brown that complements the scene."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752448001.2490938, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-6f517261-c675-4824-a133-b2b7b20d98bf", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_d80d4199.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752448001.2490938, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover.
