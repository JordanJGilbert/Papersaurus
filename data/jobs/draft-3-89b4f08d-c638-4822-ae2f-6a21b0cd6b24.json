{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover for Sarah's birthday, humorous and lighthearted theme. A full-body cartoon illustration of the two people from the reference photo, highly resembling them, positioned in the center of the card. The man on the left and the woman on the right are depicted mid-laugh, struggling to assemble a ridiculously complicated piece of furniture with confusing instructions scattered around them. The woman, holding a tiny Allen key with a perplexed expression, points at a diagram that shows an impossible-to-build shape. The man, wearing his exact same clothes and glasses, is holding a hammer upside down and looking at a single leftover screw with mock horror. The scene is full of playful chaos and shared amusement. Below them, in the safe center area, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Sarah! Hope your day is easier to put together than this!\" written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script.\n\nThe entire design is a flat 2D artwork in a beautiful watercolor painting style. It features soft, flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture background, and organic paint bleeds at the edges of the illustration, creating a warm, handcrafted feel.\n\n--style \ud83c\udfa8 Watercolor --seed 3f6d0633-cbab-4d4e-9065-b7949ca5c2f5\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sarah", "fromField": "James", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ed65d0107a99ea743b81f9b1e076cb0f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278821.3773475, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-89b4f08d-c638-4822-ae2f-6a21b0cd6b24", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_9be096c8.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278821.3773475, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover for Sarah's birthday, humorous and lighthearted theme.
