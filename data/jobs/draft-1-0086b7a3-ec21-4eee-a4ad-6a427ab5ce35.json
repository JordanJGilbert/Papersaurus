{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a birthday card front, in a beautiful watercolor style. The scene features a humorous and lighthearted cartoon couple based on the people in the reference photo.\n\nThe couple is posed in a comically dramatic dance dip. The man, Jordan, is dipping the woman, Lao Lao. Jordan, a young Asian man with short, dark, slightly messy hair, has a huge, confident grin. He is wearing a simple tan hoodie and dark reddish-maroon pants. Lao Lao, a young East Asian woman with long, straight dark hair and round gold-rimmed glasses, has a hilariously surprised expression, with wide eyes and her mouth open in a little \"o\" shape. She is wearing a light blue sweatshirt (with no text) and black pants. One of her arms is flung out dramatically for balance.\n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a soft, flowing watercolor style with visible paper texture, artistic brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. The background is a minimalist wash of soft blues and grays, hinting at the water and sky from the original photo but keeping the focus entirely on the couple.\n\nIn the center of the card, in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Birthday to my favorite dance partner!\"\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-2057babccba374a272f0a3c3fa253ed6"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752284544.466538, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-0086b7a3-ec21-4eee-a4ad-6a427ab5ce35", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_60140a17.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752284544.466538, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Flat 2D illustration for a birthday card front, in a beautiful watercolor style.
