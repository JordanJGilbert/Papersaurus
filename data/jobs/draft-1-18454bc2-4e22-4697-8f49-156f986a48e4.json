A humorous and charming scene featuring cartoon versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo. They are on a gentle, snowy ski slope surrounded by lush, out-of-place tropical and botanical plants, like large monstera leaves, ferns, and hibiscus flowers peeking through the snow. Lao Lao is skiing slightly ahead with a joyful, triumphant expression, expertly balancing a large boba tea in one hand. Jordan is skiing behind her, looking slightly clumsy and comically panicked, arms flailing as he tries not to spill his own boba tea. Both are wearing colorful, modern ski jackets and beanies. The snow is kicked up playfully around their skis. The overall style is whimsical and vibrant, blending the aesthetics of a ski resort with a tropical garden.\n\nCentered on the card, in a clear space between the two characters, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao\" written in a beautiful, readable handwritten cursive script."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-f2a797f6db576724bce84b81484f86b8"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752413993.0582833, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-1-18454bc2-4e22-4697-8f49-156f986a48e4", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_f00caf26.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752413993.0582833, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover, beautiful botanical flat 2D illustration.
