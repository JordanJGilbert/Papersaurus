{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of two people, Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the provided reference photos, celebrating Lao Lao's birthday with a humorous twist. The scene is set against a soft, cream-colored watercolor paper texture background with gentle, artistic paint bleeds around the edges. In the center, a highly recognizable cartoon version of Lao Lao, with her short gray hair, glasses, and smiling expression, is depicted wearing her gray t-shirt and dark pants. Standing next to her is the cartoon version of Jordan, with his short dark hair, glasses, and cheerful smile, wearing his black t-shirt and shorts. Jordan is playfully holding up a giant, oversized watercolor-painted carrot with a single birthday candle sticking out of the top, as if presenting it to Lao Lao like a birthday cake. Lao Lao is looking at the carrot with a surprised and amused expression, one hand raised to her cheek in a classic \"oh my!\" gesture. The illustration style is whimsical and charming, with soft flowing colors, visible brush strokes, and organic paint bleeds. In the center area, above the characters, the greeting text \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao!\" is written in a beautiful, readable, elegant handwritten cursive script, rendered in a dark teal watercolor.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-4e8fd38a8183241a80149432346ebf03"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752283323.6944745, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-3-4b0785de-6f65-45c1-b36e-7dac9ed90099", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_75a941fe.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752283323.6944745, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A flat 2D watercolor illustration of two people, Lao Lao and Jordan, based on the provided reference photos, celebrating Lao Lao's birthday with a humorous twist.
