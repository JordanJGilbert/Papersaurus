{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "Greeting card front cover. Comic book style art with bold outlines, halftones, and a vibrant, saturated color palette.\n\n**Scene:** A ridiculously fun and chaotic dim sum picnic on a sunny beach. In the center, a bright, graphic surfboard rests on the sand, acting as a makeshift picnic table.\n\n**Characters & Action:**\n*   **Lao Lao (person on the left in photo)** and **Jordan (person on the right in photo)** are illustrated in a dynamic, expressive comic book style.\n*   They are sitting cross-legged on a large beach towel next to the surfboard table, laughing hysterically. Lao Lao is animatedly pointing at a mischievous seagull, mid-laugh with a wide, joyous smile. Jordan is holding up a har gow (shrimp dumpling) with chopsticks, looking amused by the scene.\n*   Lao Lao wears her light blue sweatshirt from the photo. Jordan wears his tan hoodie.\n\n**Surroundings & Details:**\n*   The surfboard is laden with stacks of bamboo steamers, some open to reveal colorful dim sum like shumai, dumplings, and custard buns. A couple of boba tea cups with wide straws are also on the surfboard.\n*   Surrounding the couple are several cheeky seagulls. Each seagull is wearing a ridiculously tiny, slightly askew white chef's hat (toque). One bold seagull is trying to make off with a dumpling, while another struts proudly in the foreground.\n*   The background shows a bright blue ocean with playful waves, a clear sky, and soft sand. The entire scene has a high-energy, action-filled comic book feel, perhaps with a \"POW!\" or \"YUM!\" sound effect bubble in the background.\n\n**Composition:**\n*   A low-angle, dynamic shot that makes the scene feel larger than life. The couple is the main focus, with the seagulls creating a comical frame around them.
