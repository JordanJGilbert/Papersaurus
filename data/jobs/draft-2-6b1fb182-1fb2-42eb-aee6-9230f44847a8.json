In the center, two people are depicted as cartoon characters, based on the reference photo [67e31c72-d798-4a3b-b9c2-506e335da316]. The characters are drawn in a lighthearted style, highly resembling the individuals in the photo, including their exact hairstyles, facial features, body proportions, and clothing (omitting any logos/text). The person on the left is playfully attempting to place a tiny, comically small party hat on the head of the person on the right, who has a surprised and amused expression. The background is a soft, celebratory wash of pastel colors like light teal, soft pink, and pale yellow, with whimsical confetti and streamer shapes subtly integrated into the watercolor bleeds and splatters.\n\nIn the center of the card, overlaying the illustration, is the text \"Happy Birthday, Sarah! Don't worry, we'll get you a bigger hat.\" written in a beautiful, readable, and elegant handwritten cursive script. The artwork is flat 2D, styled as a watercolor painting with soft flowing colors, visible artistic brush strokes, a subtle paper texture, and organic paint bleeds at the edges.\n\n- Reference photos provided for character creation\n- Characters should only appear on the front cover\n- Transform real people into artistic cartoon/illustrated versions matching the style\n- Maintain recognizable features while adapting to the artistic style"}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "low", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Sarah", "fromField": "James", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-ed65d0107a99ea743b81f9b1e076cb0f"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752278821.1021266, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-2-6b1fb182-1fb2-42eb-aee6-9230f44847a8", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_c1f8ce9a.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752278821.1021266, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous watercolor illustration for a birthday card front cover.
