{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A minimalist and charming flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front. Against a clean, solid off-white background, two adorable cartoon sloths are depicted. The first sloth, representing the boyfriend, is hanging upside down from an invisible branch at the top of the frame. He wears a tiny, festive party hat askew on his head and has a wide, beaming smile, looking directly at the second sloth. He is enthusiastically offering a single, elegantly wrapped birthday gift box tied with a simple ribbon. The second sloth, representing Lao Lao, is positioned upright at the bottom of the frame, looking up with a surprised and delighted expression, her tiny arms outstretched to receive the gift. The sloths are drawn with simple, elegant lines and shapes, in soft, muted tones of brown and beige. The composition is clean and centered.\n\nIn the open space between the two sloths, elegant, handwritten cursive script in a dark charcoal grey color reads: \"Happy Birthday, Lao Lao... sorry this is late, I hurried.\" The text is beautifully rendered and easy to read. The overall design is minimalist, humorous, and full of charming personality."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true}, "createdAt": 1752445078.657516, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-4-e8538cc7-95e7-416f-a93e-30ac40973750", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_7a22c4cc.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752445078.657516, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A minimalist and charming flat 2D illustration for a greeting card front.
