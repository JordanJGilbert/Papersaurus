{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor greeting card front. The scene is a ridiculously idyllic and cute beach. Whimsical pastel waves in shades of aqua and seafoam green gently lap against a sandy shore. Instead of seashells, the beach is scattered with adorable, smiling boba pearls. In the center, cartoon watercolor versions of Lao Lao and Jordan from the reference photo are featured. Lao Lao, wearing a similar blue sweatshirt, is gleefully trying to build a sandcastle, but the sandcastle is shaped like a giant boba tea cup, complete with a straw made of driftwood. Jordan, in a similar brown hoodie, is playfully trying to \"steal\" one of the boba pearl \"seashells\" from her sandcastle, holding it up with a mischievous grin. They are both laughing. The overall feeling is bright, funny, and sweet. In the sky above them, soft, wispy clouds spell out the greeting in a beautiful, flowing, readable handwritten cursive script: \"Happy Birthday Lao Lao\". The artwork style is flat 2D with soft edges, flowing colors, and visible watercolor paper texture, perfect for a printed card."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 85, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "birthday", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-abbac555f1b6d69a23d96d7d3be30cce"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752447875.0897307, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-405dd4d6-d188-424a-9655-7914308cb561", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_8ccbd157.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752447875.0897307, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and lighthearted watercolor greeting card front.
