{"status": "completed", "prompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and vibrant watercolor illustration for a greeting card front. In a whimsical, slightly chaotic beach scene, the cartoon-style couple from the reference photo are having a picnic. The setting is a beautiful beach with turquoise water, soft white sand, and palm trees with watercolor washes of color.\n\nLao Lao (person on the left) and Jordan (person on the right) are sitting on a beach blanket, both laughing joyfully. They are depicted in the same clothing from the photo (Lao Lao in her black puffer jacket, Jordan in his black jacket with a shearling collar and dark grey crewneck underneath, both omitting any text/logos).\n\nInstead of a traditional picnic basket, they are surrounded by an exaggerated, comical feast of Chinese food. Oversized takeout containers are scattered around them, with comically long noodles flying through the air as they try to eat with chopsticks. A giant soup dumpling sits between them, and a few mischievous crabs are attempting to steal potstickers from a plate. The whole scene is full of movement and lighthearted fun.\n\nIn the center of the image, written in a beautiful, flowing handwritten cursive script, is the text: \"Happy Anniversary, my love!\". The text is positioned clearly against a lighter wash of the sky or sand. The entire artwork is rendered in a loose, expressive watercolor style with soft edges, vibrant color splashes, and a charming, flat 2D look perfect for a greeting card."}, "config": {"userNumber": "+17145986105", "modelVersion": "gpt-image-1", "aspectRatio": "9:16", "quality": "medium", "outputFormat": "jpeg", "outputCompression": 100, "moderation": "low", "dimensions": "1024x1536", "isFrontBackOnly": true, "userEmail": "jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "cardType": "anniversary", "toField": "Lao Lao", "fromField": "Jordan", "isDraftMode": true, "input_images": ["https://vibecarding.com/serve_image?key=upload-d1af38ed4db92f93d2da15e4947adf2d"], "input_images_mode": "front_cover_only"}, "createdAt": 1752504690.5007682, "progress": "Generation complete!", "cardData": {"id": "draft-0-ac2837e9-b809-4a3f-a6e7-c77fdd96a11a", "prompt": "Generated card for jordan.j.gilbert@gmail.com", "frontCover": "https://vibecarding.com/user_data/17145986105/images/gpt_image_api_4d840bd6.png", "backCover": "", "leftPage": "", "rightPage": "", "createdAt": 1752504690.5007682, "generatedPrompts": {"frontCover": "A humorous and vibrant watercolor illustration for a greeting card front.
