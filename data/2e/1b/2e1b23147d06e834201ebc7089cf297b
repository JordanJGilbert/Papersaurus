BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the humorous and lighthearted tone throughout all sections\n- Include visual humor, playful elements, and whimsical details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"thank-you\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a warm, whimsical watercolor and ink illustration style. The scene depicts a soft, smiling, elderly Lao woman (Lao Lao) with kind eyes and gentle wrinkles, winking conspiratorially as she offers a steaming bamboo basket of dumplings to a delighted young person (Jordan). The characters are rendered with loose, expressive ink lines that have a friendly, hand-drawn feel, while the watercolor fills are soft and blended, with colors bleeding gently into one another to create a feeling of warmth and cherished memory. The color palette is cozy and inviting, dominated by golden yellows, soft persimmon oranges, and warm, tea-stained browns, evoking the feeling of a sunlit kitchen. Little puffs of steam rising from the dumplings are painted in a light, almost translucent white, adding to the charm and deliciousness of the moment. The background is simple and uncluttered, perhaps just a soft wash of color, keeping the focus entirely on this heartfelt, joyful exchange.\n\n2.
