FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the sincere and emotional tone throughout all sections\n- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SAFETY: If the user mentions specific characters, brands, logos, or products, automatically replace them with original generic alternatives in your prompts. For example: replace specific character names with \"cartoon mouse character\" or \"superhero character\", replace brand names with \"colorful cereal\" or \"sports car\", etc. Create inspired-by designs that capture the essence without referencing any protected names or specific copyrighted elements. Never include actual brand names, character names, or trademarked terms in the image generation prompts\n- CONTENT SAFETY: Ensure all prompts are family-friendly and appropriate for greeting cards. Avoid any content that could be flagged by safety systems including: violence, weapons, inappropriate imagery, political content, controversial topics, scary or disturbing elements, or anything not suitable for all ages. If the user requests something potentially inappropriate, redirect to positive, wholesome alternatives that capture their intent in a family-friendly way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"thank-you\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). TEXT STYLE: Write the greeting text in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that matches the elegant style used inside the card - legible, flowing, and graceful with natural character and warmth. Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n2. Left Interior (Story Development): UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY! You have complete creative freedom to design whatever you want for this left interior page! This is your artistic playground - create something genuinely innovative and unexpected that feels right for a thank-you card with sincere and emotional tone. You can include: scenes, landscapes, objects, patterns, quotes, text, illustrations, realistic art, abstract art, or anything else that inspires you - but NO PEOPLE or characters unless the user specifically mentioned wanting people in their card description. Position any text safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10%). Think of something no one has done before! Surprise us with bold, imaginative, and memorable artistic choices while maintaining visual harmony with the overall card style and tone. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n3. Right Interior (Story Climax): BE CREATIVE WITH MESSAGE DESIGN! Include message text: \"Thank you for your friendship and kindness!\n\nSo grateful for you! \n\nmahalo piha \nmuch aloha\nmel\" positioned safely in center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image) integrated into beautiful, innovative decorative artwork. HANDWRITING STYLE: Write the message in beautiful, clearly readable handwritten cursive script that feels elegant and personal. The handwriting should be legible, flowing, and have natural character - not overly perfect but graceful and warm. Use a nice pen-style appearance with natural ink flow and slight variations in line weight. Think of sophisticated calligraphy that's still approachable and easy to read. Make the handwriting feel genuine and heartfelt. Think beyond typical florals and patterns - create something unexpected and artistic that perfectly frames the handwritten message - NO PEOPLE or characters. This should feel like the emotional peak of the card experience, harmonizing with the left interior as a cohesive spread. Avoid clich\u00e9 designs and create something genuinely special! Use the elegant cursive handwriting style described above. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\n4. Back Cover (Story Resolution): BE SUBTLY CREATIVE! Create a simple yet innovative decorative design that brings peaceful closure to the visual story. Reference subtle elements from the front cover but keep it minimal and serene - NO PEOPLE, just beautiful, unexpected artistic elements that go beyond typical patterns or florals. IMPORTANT: Leave the bottom-right corner area (approximately 1 inch square) completely clear and undecorated - this space is reserved for a QR code. Focus decorative elements toward the center and left side of the design. Think of something quietly beautiful and memorable that complements the overall design while being genuinely unique. This should feel like a peaceful, artistic ending that surprises with its subtle creativity. Style: in watercolor painting style, with soft flowing colors, artistic brush strokes, paper texture, and organic paint bleeds\n\nVISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:\n- Same color palette across all sections\n- Consistent lighting/time of day\n- Same artistic techniques and brushwork\n- Recurring visual motifs or symbols (but make them unique and memorable!)\n- Progressive emotional journey from introduction to resolution\n- Front cover: stylized cartoon/illustrated characters if people are needed for the theme\n- Left interior: CREATIVE FREEDOM but NO PEOPLE unless user specifically requested people in their description\n- Right interior: focus on message space with innovative decorative elements (NO PEOPLE)\n- Back cover: simple yet creative decorative design without text or people\n- Use simplified, friendly, charming character design if including people (front cover only)\n- CREATIVITY PRIORITY: Always choose the more innovative, surprising, and memorable option over generic designs\n\nReturn JSON:\n{\n  \"frontCover\": \"detailed prompt with story opening elements\",\n  \"backCover\": \"detailed prompt with story conclusion elements\",\n  \"leftInterior\": \"detailed prompt with story development elements\",\n  \"rightInterior\": \"detailed prompt with story climax elements\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Create a completely unique and different interpretation for this specific card variant.
