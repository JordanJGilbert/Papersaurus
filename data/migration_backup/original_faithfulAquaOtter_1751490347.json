FRONT COVER: First impression - sets the scene/introduces the story\n2. INTERIOR SPREAD: The heart of the experience - continuation and climax of the visual story\n3. BACK COVER: Conclusion - peaceful resolution or complementary ending\n\nRequirements:\n- Flat 2D artwork for printing (not 3D card images)\n- Full-bleed backgrounds extending to edges\n- IMPORTANT: Keep text, faces, and key elements at least 10% away from top/bottom edges (small amount may be cropped in printing)\n- Keep text/faces 0.5\" from left/right edges for safe printing\n- CONSISTENT visual elements throughout: same characters, color palette, lighting, art style\n- Progressive visual storytelling from front \u2192 interior \u2192 back\n- Put any text in quotes and make it clear/readable\n- Each section should feel like part of the same artistic universe\n- TONE: Ensure the visual mood and atmosphere matches the sincere and emotional tone throughout all sections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate prompts that flow chronologically:\n\n1. Front Cover (Opening Scene): BE GENUINELY CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! Include \"retirement\" greeting text positioned safely in the center area (avoid top/bottom 10% of image). Create charming cartoon-style or stylized illustrated figures if people are needed for the theme. This is the story opening - introduce key visual elements (colors, motifs, artistic style) that will continue throughout the other sections. Think of something unexpected, innovative, and memorable that will surprise and delight the recipient. Avoid generic designs! Style: in a contemporary layered papercut diorama style. The artwork should be digitally rendered to look like a three-dimensional, hand-crafted scene with tangible depth and texture. The foreground features a silhouette of a father and an adult child (Jordan, gender-neutral) standing together on a gentle hill, looking out at the scene ahead. The father figure has a subtle, relaxed posture, perhaps with a hand on Jordan's shoulder. The middle ground depicts a beautifully detailed landscape that symbolizes the father's new freedom: rolling hills, a winding country road leading towards a serene lake, and perhaps a small, cozy cabin with a wisp of smoke from the chimney. The background is a breathtaking, multi-layered sunset, created with a warm, gradient color palette transitioning from a deep, gentle navy at the top, through rich oranges, soft pinks, and a final, brilliant golden yellow at the horizon. Each layer of the papercut (hills, trees, clouds, sun) is rendered with a subtle drop shadow and a delicate, textured paper-like finish, creating a convincing illusion of depth. The overall mood is one of peaceful accomplishment, warmth, and hopeful new beginnings, perfectly capturing the love and pride in Jordan's message.\n\n2.
