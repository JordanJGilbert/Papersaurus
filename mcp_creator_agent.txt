# MCP Server Creator Agent - Design Document

## Overview
A two-phase AI-driven system for creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that ensures clear requirements gathering before autonomous implementation.

## Architecture: Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Co-Pilot Phase (Requirements & Design)
**Goal**: Collaborative requirement gathering and design agreement between user and AI

#### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Requirements Discovery**
   - Interactive dialogue to understand user's high-level goals
   - Identify the domain/use case for the MCP server
   - Determine what problems the server should solve

2. **Tool Design & Specification**
   - Define each tool the MCP server will provide
   - Collaborate on input schemas for each tool
   - Design output schemas for each tool
   - Validate tool interfaces make sense for the use case

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Identify if the MCP server needs to call external MCP tools
   - Map out which external tools are required
   - Verify external tool availability and compatibility

4. **Project Specification Creation**
   - Generate a high-level project overview
   - Document the server's purpose and capabilities
   - Create a clear implementation roadmap

#### Interaction Pattern:
- Back-and-forth conversation until mutual agreement
- AI asks clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements
- User can refine and adjust specifications
- Final approval checkpoint before moving to Phase 2

#### Deliverables:
- **Project Spec**: High-level description of MCP server purpose
- **Tool Specifications**: Complete input/output schemas for each tool
- **Dependency Map**: List of external MCP tools required
- **Implementation Agreement**: Signed-off requirements document

### Phase 2: Agent Phase (Autonomous Implementation)
**Goal**: Autonomous code generation, iteration, and testing until requirements are satisfied

#### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Code Generation**
   - Generate initial MCP server implementation
   - Use the existing `create_mcp_server` tool from the server creation system
   - Follow FastMCP patterns and best practices

2. **Self-Iteration**
   - Test generated code against requirements
   - Identify gaps or issues in implementation
   - Use `edit_mcp_server` tool to make corrections
   - Repeat until all requirements are met

3. **Validation & Testing**
   - Verify each tool works as specified
   - Test input/output schemas match the agreed design
   - Validate external MCP tool integrations
   - Ensure error handling and edge cases are covered

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Code review against best practices
   - Performance optimization if needed
   - Documentation generation
   - Final validation against Phase 1 specifications

#### Autonomous Capabilities:
- Self-directed problem solving
- Iterative improvement without user intervention
- Automated testing and validation
- Error detection and correction

## System Components

### 1. Co-Pilot Interface

- **Quality Checker**: Ensures code meets standards

### 3. Integration Layer
- **MCP Server Creation API**: Interfaces with existing server creation tools
- **External Tool Registry**: Manages available MCP tools for integration
- **Version Control**: Tracks iterations and changes
- **Validation Framework**: Tests generated servers

## Workflow

### Phase 1 Workflow:
1. **Initial Consultation**
   - User describes high-level goals
   - AI asks clarifying questions
   - Scope and complexity assessment

2. **Tool Design Session**
   - For each identified tool:
     - Define purpose and functionality
     - Design input schema collaboratively
     - Design output schema collaboratively
     - Validate tool interface

3. **Dependency Planning**
   - Identify external MCP tools needed
   - Verify tool availability
   - Plan integration approach

4. **Specification Review**
   - Present complete project specification
   - User review and approval
   - Final adjustments if needed

5. **Handoff to Phase 2**
   - Package all specifications
   - Initialize Agent Phase

### Phase 2 Workflow:
1. **Implementation Planning**
   - Analyze Phase 1 specifications
   - Create implementation strategy
   - Identify potential challenges

2. **Initial Code Generation**
   - Generate MCP server skeleton
   - Implement each tool according to specs
   - Add external tool integrations

3. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Test implementation
   - Identify issues or gaps
   - Make corrections and improvements
   - Repeat until requirements satisfied

4. **Final Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Specification compliance check
   - Performance validation
   - Documentation generation

5. **Delivery**
   - Present completed MCP server
   - Provide usage documentation
   - Offer deployment guidance

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1 Technical Stack:
- **Conversation Engine**: Structured dialogue management
- **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema tools for input/output design
- **Requirement Tracking**: Structured storage of evolving requirements
- **External Tool Discovery**: API to query available MCP tools

### Phase 2 Technical Stack:
- **Code Generation**: Integration with existing `create_mcp_server` tool
- **Testing Framework**: Automated validation of generated code
- **Iteration Engine**: Self-directed improvement capabilities
- **Quality Metrics**: Code quality and performance measurement

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success:
- Clear, unambiguous project specification
- Complete tool schemas (input/output)
- Validated external dependencies
- User approval and sign-off

### Phase 2 Success:
- Working MCP server that meets all specifications
- All tools function as designed
- External integrations work correctly
- Code passes quality standards
- Comprehensive testing completed

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Phase 1 ensures clear requirements before implementation
2. **Higher Quality**: Autonomous iteration in Phase 2 improves code quality
3. **User Confidence**: Clear agreement phase builds trust
4. **Efficiency**: Autonomous implementation reduces back-and-forth during coding
