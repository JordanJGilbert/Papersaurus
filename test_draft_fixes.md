# Draft Card Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
Draft cards were not persisting after page refresh because they were only stored in React state but not saved back to localStorage when completed.

## Root Cause
1. When draft cards completed via WebSocket, they were added to the `draftCards` state array
2. However, the localStorage job data was never updated with the completed draft cards
3. On page refresh, `checkPendingJobs` would find the jobs but with empty `draftCards` arrays

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Save Draft Cards to localStorage on Completion
In `useCardStudioRefactored.ts`, when a draft card completes:
```typescript
// Update draft cards state
draftGeneration.setDraftCards(prev => {
  const updated = [...prev];
  updated.push(draftCard);
  
  // Save updated draft cards to localStorage for recovery
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    try {
      const jobData = localStorage.getItem(`cardJob_${job_id}`);
      if (jobData) {
        const job = JSON.parse(jobData);
        job.draftCards = updated;
        job.lastUpdate = Date.now();
        localStorage.setItem(`cardJob_${job_id}`, JSON.stringify(job));
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to update draft cards in localStorage:', error);
    }
  }
  
  return updated;
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Draft Card Recovery
Improved `checkPendingJobs` to:
- Separate draft jobs from final jobs
- Collect all draft cards from all draft jobs
- Restore draft cards, mappings, and completion count
- Set appropriate UI state based on completion status
- Subscribe to incomplete draft jobs for continued updates

### 3. Key Improvements
- Draft cards now persist in localStorage immediately upon completion
- Multiple draft jobs are properly aggregated on recovery
- Proper restoration of draft index mappings
- Correct UI state (progress messages, completion status) on refresh
- Handles both partial (e.g., 3/5) and complete (5/5) draft states

## Testing Instructions

1. **Generate Draft Cards**:
   - Start the card creation wizard
   - Complete steps 1-4
   - Click "Generate Draft Cards" in step 5
   - Wait for some draft cards to complete

2. **Test Persistence**:
   - Once you see draft cards appear, refresh the page
   - Draft cards should be restored and visible
   - Progress should show correct completion count (e.g., "3/5 variations complete")

3. **Verify localStorage**:
   - Open browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage
   - Look for entries like `cardJob_draft-0-xxxx`
   - Verify each has a populated `draftCards` array

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Refresh during generation (partial completion)
   - Refresh after all 5 drafts complete
   - Clear one draft job but keep others

## Expected Behavior
- Draft cards persist across page refreshes
- Correct progress indication is maintained
- Users can continue where they left off
- No duplicate draft cards on recovery
