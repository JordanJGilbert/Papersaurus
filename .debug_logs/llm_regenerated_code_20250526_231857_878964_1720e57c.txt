--- Edit request: ---
Correct the image URL extraction. Change `image_urls = image_generation_response.get('image_urls', [])` to `results = image_generation_response.get('results', [])
image_urls = [item[0] for item in results if isinstance(item, list) and len(item) > 0]` to correctly parse the nested list of URLs returned by `generate_images_with_prompts`.
