--- End of original code ---

--- Edit request: ---
In the generated_function_name, when calling _call_mcp_tool for 'generate_images_with_prompts', the arguments dictionary should pass a list of prompts. Change {"prompt": prompt} to {"prompts": [prompt]}. Also ensure the user_number argument is passed to the generate_images_with_prompts tool, it should be the user_id variable that is an argument to generated_function_name.
